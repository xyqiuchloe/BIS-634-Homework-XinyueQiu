    "Suppose we have a neural network for predicting the time between hospital readmissions for a certain subset of patients. Such a network would depends on many parameters, but for simplicity, let's assume there's only two parameters: a and b. Each parameter lies between 0 and 1 and represents the weights of two \"synapses\" in our model.\n",
