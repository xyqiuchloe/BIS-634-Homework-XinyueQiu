To reveal transcriptome differences among subgroups, we certificated specific upregulated genes and annotated the biological function.

Therefore, our aim is to perform a systematic review of the predictors of response to AChEI in neurodegenerative dementias, providing a categorization and interpretation of the results. We conducted a systematic review of the literature up to December 31st, 2021, searching five different databases and registers, including studies on rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine, with clearly defined criteria for the diagnosis of dementia and the response to AChEI therapy.

We identified 1,994 records in five different databases; after exclusion of duplicates, title and abstract screening, and full-text retrieval, 122 studies were finally included. The studies show high heterogeneity in duration, response definition, drug dosage, and diagnostic criteria. Response to AChEI seems associated with correlates of cholinergic deficit (hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, substantia innominate atrophy) and preserved cholinergic neurons (faster alpha on REM sleep EEG, increased anterior frontal and parietal lobe perfusion after donepezil); white matter hyperintensities in the cholinergic pathways have shown inconsistent results. The K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase may correlate with better response in late stages of disease, while the role of polymorphisms in other genes involved in the cholinergic system is controversial. Factors related to drug availability may influence response; in particular, low serum albumin (for donepezil), CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced enzymatic activity and higher drug doses are the most consistent predictors, while AChEI concentration influence on clinical outcomes is debatable. Other predictors of response include faster disease progression, lower serum cholesterol, preserved medial temporal lobes, apathy, absence of concomitant diseases, and absence of antipsychotics.

These glycans are heterogeneous and have diverse chemical structures whose composition is sensitive to manufacturing conditions, rendering the understanding of how specific glycan structures affect mAb bioactivity challenging. There is a need to delineate the effects of specific glycans on mAb bioactivity to determine whether changes in certain glycosylation profiles (that can occur during manufacturing) will significantly affect product quality. Using enzymatic transglycosylation with chemically-defined N-glycans, we show that galactosylation at a specific location of N-glycans in an afucosylated anti-viral mAb is responsible for Fc\u03b3RIIIA binding and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity.

To observe neutrophil-like polymorphonuclear cells, we performed Hematoxylin-Eosin staining on glioma tissues.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the protective potential of terpenoids found in C. sativa in the GNS and CholNS of C. elegans. The effect of two C. sativa oils with variations in CBD and THC concentrations on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation, and behavior of C. elegans was evaluated. C. sativa oils were efficient in increasing pharyngeal pumping rate and reducing defecation cycle, AChE activity, and ROS levels in N2 strains. In the muscle:Abeta1-42 strain, mainly when using CBD oil, worm movement, body bends, and pharyngeal pumping were increased, with a reduced AChE activity. Consequently, greater investments in scientific research are needed, in addition to breaking the taboo on the use of the C. sativa plant as an alternative for medicinal use, especially in neurodegenerative diseases, which have already shown positive initial results.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36308925": {"ArticleTitle": "The impact of standardized structured reporting of pathology reports for breast cancer care.", "AbstractText": "With the increasing complexity of modern oncological patient management and the growing amount of information needed from the pathologist, traditional narrative pathology reports (NR) do not suffice.

We explore the impact of synoptic reporting on breast cancer care. Using data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and Dutch Nationwide Pathology Databank, a retrospective population-based cohort study was performed. Data of breast cancer resections from 2007 to 2014 were collected to compare NR and SR for all outcome measures. Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank testing were used to estimate overall survival. Over time there was an increase from 12% to 78.9% in the use of SR. SR resulted in higher completeness of pathology reports, particularly for hormone and HER2/neu receptor status. Although there was no difference in the administration of antihormonal therapy, anti-HER2 treatment was more frequently administered to eligible patients in the SR group. An effect on overall survival could not yet be confirmed on multivariate analysis. We demonstrate that SR has led to more complete pathology reports, which meets the needs for precision of information in breast cancer care. This is expected to improve communication and discussions between specialists regarding parameters important for adjuvant breast cancer treatment decisions. SR thereby improves breast cancer care and leads to improved allocation of treatment based on pathologic parameters and more personalized treatment regimens.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36152312": {"ArticleTitle": "Associations of grip strength, walking pace, and the risk of incident dementia: A prospective cohort study of 340212 participants.", "AbstractText": "Grip strength and walking pace have been linked to cognitive dysfunction.

Here, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed that LINC01089 expression is remarkably reduced in thyroid cancer tissues. Lower LINC01089 expression was correlated with higher tumor stage and regional lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, LINC01089 overexpression effectively blocked thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. LINC01089 acted as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-27b-3p, thus inhibiting miR-27b-3p expression. miR-27b-3p overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of thyroid cancer, reversing the effect of LINC01089 overexpression on thyroid cancer. Fibulin-5 (FBLN5) was discovered as a target of miR-27b-3p in thyroid cancer. FBLN5 expression was found to be underexpressed in thyroid cancer and was enhanced and reduced by LINC00987 overexpression and miR-27b-3p overexpression, respectively. Furthermore, FBLN5 knockdown promoted the malignant progression of thyroid cancer cells by counteracting the effect of LINC00987.

It serves as a foundation for atherosclerotic lesions that can be destabilized by co-inflammatory processes leading to distal clot migration and other related CVD events. There are many misconceptions regarding the management of DLD. Many health sectors advocate for weight loss without a clear-cut target to achieve better CVD outcomes. There is growing evidence that exercise training compliance regardless of weight change is a more reliable indicator of favorable outcomes. This review is intended to understand the relationship between exercise training, lipoprotein readings, and with CVD and all-cause morbidity and mortality. Aerobic exercise training (aET) and resistance exercise training (rET) increase cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscular strength (MusS), respectively. Regardless of weight loss, aET and rET are both known to independently reduce mortality possibly partly through improvement of lipid profiles. Of the two modes of exercise, rET has propensity for enhanced compliance because of its significant lipid and mortality-attenuating effect even with just brief exercise sessions. However, there are several studies showing that participation in both modes of exercise causes more pronounced improvements in DLD and CVD-related mortality compared with either mode of exercise training alone. In addition, Lipoprotein-a [Lp(a)] has been increasingly acknowledged to be atherogenic because of its LDL core. The close proximity of Lp(a) with macrophages triggers the development of atheromas, plaque formation, and growth. This causes a cascade of inflammatory processes that increase the development of ischemic CVD and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Although exercise training is known to reduce plasma LDL-C levels, it has no direct effect on Lp(a) levels as the latter lipoprotein is not influenced by motion nor exercise. Reviews of multiple studies lead us to infer that exercise training may potentially have an indirect impact on Lp(a) attenuation because of the ability of exercise training to inhibit Proprotein Convertase Subtisilin/Kexin type-9 (PCSK-9), as some studies using pharmacologic therapy with PCSK-9 inhibitors were able to show a concomitant decrease in Lp(a) levels. It is clear that normal-to-overweight populations who are highly active have better CVD outcomes and lipid profiles than their sedentary counterparts, and those who were underweight and unfit fared much worse. This allows us to take a more precise approach in the management of DLD rather than plainly focusing on gross weight in patients. Exercise training certainly has beneficial impact on longevity owing to its advantageous effect on lipoprotein levels and particle size. As such, reputable health societies, such as the ESC, ACC, and AHA have prescribed the ideal exercise training regimen, which have noticeable similarities. Increasing the use of wearable devices may help improve our ability to prescribe, quantify, and precisely track physical activity in our continuing efforts to combat increasing morbidity related to unhealthy lifestyles and inactivity.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36306403": {"ArticleTitle": "Impact of Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity Trajectories on Colon Cancer Risk Over the Adult Life Course.", "AbstractText": "Moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) reduces colon cancer risk; however, it is unclear how the timing of MVPA throughout the adult life course impacts colon cancer risk.

Also, eQTL and chromatin state changes were analyzed and correlated with the survival of patients using available datasets. In our population smoking correlated significantly with lung cancer [OR= 2.607] with the presence of the minor allele 'A' enhancing the nicotine dependence [CA (OR=3.23)]. Individuals with homozygous risk allele 'A' had a higher chance of developing lung cancer [OR=2.65] than individuals with CA/CC implying a recessive model of association. Patients with CC/CA genotype had better overall survival than patients with AA genotype [161 days/142 days vs 54 days, p=0.005]. The homozygous risk allele was significantly associated with increased DCBLD1 and ROS1 expression in lung cancer, with enriched active histone marks due to the polymorphism.

Several disease variables were coherent with this pattern, from bone marrow MC infiltration to MC-related histopathological traits, that also accounted for a significantly higher incidence of clonal MC activation syndrome in H\u03b1T+ (10.2%) compared to H\u03b1T- (3.4%, P=0.029) patients. We also confirmed that H\u03b1T+ carriers had a significantly higher frequency of anaphylaxis, without relevant differences for other clinical manifestations.

Neurol Genet. 2020;6:e512). While the majority (>\u200990%) of EOAD cases are not caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, they do have a higher heritability (92-100%) than sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD, 70%) (Wingo et al. Arch Neurol. 2012;69:59-64, Fulton-Howard et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2021;99:101.e1-101.e9). Although the endpoint clinicopathological changes, i.e., A\u03b2 plaques, tau tangles, and cognitive decline, are common across EOAD and LOAD, the disease progression is highly heterogeneous (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). This heterogeneity, leading to temporally distinct age at onset (AAO) and stages of cognitive decline, may be caused by myriad combinations of distinct disease-associated molecular mechanisms. We and others have used transcriptome profiling in AD patient-derived neuron models of autosomal-dominant EOAD and sporadic LOAD to identify disease endotypes (Caldwell et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2020;6:eaba5933,\u00a0Mertens et al. Cell Stem Cell. 2021;28:1533-1548.e6, Caldwell et al. Alzheimers Demen. 2022). Further, analyses of large postmortem brain cohorts demonstrate that only one-third of AD patients show hallmark disease endotypes like increased inflammation and decreased synaptic signaling (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). Areas of the brain less affected by AD pathology at early disease stages-such as the primary visual cortex-exhibit similar transcriptomic dysregulation as those regions traditionally affected and, therefore, may offer a view into the molecular mechanisms of AD without the associated inflammatory changes and gliosis induced by pathology (Haroutunian et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2009;30:561-73). To this end, we analyzed AD patient samples from the primary visual cortex (19 EOAD, 20 LOAD) using transcriptomic signatures to identify patient clusters and disease endotypes. Interestingly, although the clusters showed distinct combinations and severity of endotypes, each patient cluster contained both EOAD and LOAD cases, suggesting that AAO may not directly correlate with the identity and severity of AD endotypes.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36089183": {"ArticleTitle": "Investigating the temporal pattern of neuroimaging-based brain age estimation as a biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease related neurodegeneration.", "AbstractText": "Neuroimaging-based brain-age estimation via machine learning has emerged as an important new approach for studying brain aging. The difference between one's estimated brain age and chronological age, the brain age gap (BAG), has been proposed as an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarker. However, most past studies on the BAG have been cross-sectional. Quantifying longitudinal changes in an individual's BAG temporal pattern would likely improve prediction of AD progression and clinical outcome based on neurophysiological changes. To fill this gap, our study conducted predictive modeling using a large neuroimaging dataset with up to 8 years of follow-up to examine the temporal patterns of the BAG's trajectory and how it varies by subject-level characteristics (sex, APOE\u025b4 carriership) and disease status. Specifically, we explored the pattern and rate of change in BAG over time in individuals who remain stable with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as individuals who progress to clinical AD. Combining multimodal imaging data in a support vector regression model to estimate brain age yielded improved performance over single modality. Multilevel modeling results showed the BAG followed a linear increasing trajectory with a significantly faster rate in individuals with MCI who progressed to AD compared to cognitively normal or MCI individuals who did not progress. The dynamic changes in the BAG during AD progression were further moderated by sex and APOE\u025b4 carriership.

In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning model; called generative adversarial networks constrained multiple loss autoencoder for tau (GANCMLAE4TAU), to extract individual regions of interest (ROIs) of tau deposition. The basic framework of the proposed model is composed of two encoders, one decoder, and one discriminator. Tau PET images of 327 cognitive normal (CN) subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to train the model and 29 CNs from Huashan Hospital were used as an external validation group. The other 57 AD patients and 83 CNs subjects from ADNI were used in the classification task. The Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) were applied to validate the robustness of our model. In addition, we conducted a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis for the SUVR of individual ROIs from the GANCMLAE4TAU model and compared it with SUVR of the whole brain and ROIs from the templates.

In this study, bioinformatics analysis was conducted to analyze the expression level, prognosis value and enriched pathways of NUPR1 in Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC). We found that NUPR1 was significantly upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells compared with normal hepatocytes from LIHC patients in TCGA cohorts and our patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and COX proportional hazard progression model showed that high expression of NUPR1 was correlated with a poor prognosis of LIHC patients. CCK-8, EdU and colony formation assays were performed to explore the effect of NUPR1 on the proliferation of HCC cells, then wound healing and transwell migration assays were performed to evaluate the effects of NUPR1 on cell migration. Furthermore, subcutaneous xenograft models were established to study tumor growth. Results showed that NUPR1 overexpression correlated with a highly proliferative and aggressive phenotype. In addition, NUPR1 knockdown significantly inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and migration in vitro and hindered tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, endogenous NUPR1 could interact with sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and upregulated lipogenic gene expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), resulting in the accumulation of lipid content. Moreover, pharmacological or genetic blockade of the NUPR1-SREBP1/FASN pathway enhanced anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo.

In recent years, there has been an increasing number of reports on physical function in patients with pancreatic cancer. Methods such as the 6-min walk distance (6 MWD) should be established to evaluate physical function, as a decline in exercise capacity is an important index in these patients. Recently, the 6 MWD has also been used to evaluate physical function in patients with pancreatic cancer. In healthy older adults, a decrease in 6 MWD is reportedly associated with intrinsic capacity and health status. Such factors make assessing 6 MWD important. However, the measurement of 6 MWD requires a sizable measurement environment. The five times sit to stand (FTSTS) test is a simple method that can be performed using a chair. FTSTS is hypothesized to be a useful assessment scale in patients with pancreatic cancer because it is easy to estimate the decline in physical function in clinical practice if the decline in 6 MWD can be estimated by evaluating FTSTS. The study's purpose was to clarify this hypothesis and ascertain the cutoff required to determine the decrease in 6 MWD in clinical practice. Sixty consecutive patients with preoperative pancreatic cancer who were assessed for physical function were studied. 6 MWD (<\u2009400\u00a0m) was the objective variable, and binary logistic regression analysis was performed, with age, BMI, sex, FTSTS, and HGS as explanatory variables.

However, increasing evidence suggests that the brain has to continuously produce excessive A\u03b2 to efficaciously prevent pathogenic micro-organism infections, which induces and accelerates the disease process of AD. Meanwhile, A\u03b2 exhibits activity against herpes simplex virus type\u00a01 (HSV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV) replication, but not against other neurotropic viruses. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the most important neurotropic enterovirus in the post-polio era. Given the limitation of existing research on the relationship between A\u03b2 and other virus infections, this study aimed to investigate the potent activity of A\u03b2 on EV-A71 infection and extended the potential function of A\u03b2 in other unenveloped viruses may be linked to Alzheimer's disease or infectious neurological diseases. A\u03b2 peptides 1-42 are a major pathological factor of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, we utilized A\u03b21-42 as a test subject to perform our study. The production of monomer A\u03b21-42 and their high-molecular oligomer accumulations in neural cells were detected by immunofluorescence assay, ELISA, or Western blot assay. The inhibitory activity of A\u03b21-42 peptides against EV-A71 in vitro was detected by Western blot analysis or qRT-PCR. The mechanism of A\u03b21-42 against EV-A71 replication was analyzed by time-of-addition assay, attachment inhibition assay, pre-attachment inhibition analysis, viral-penetration inhibition assay, TEM analysis of virus agglutination, and pull-down assay. We found that EV-A71 infection induced A\u03b2 production and accumulation in SH-SY5Y cells. We also revealed for the first time that A\u03b21-42 efficiently inhibited the RNA level of EV-A71 VP1, and the protein levels of VP1, VP2, and nonstructural protein 3AB in SH-SY5Y, Vero, and human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that A\u03b21-42 primarily targeted the early stage of EV-A71 entry to inhibit virus replication by binding virus capsid protein VP1 or scavenger receptor class B member 2. Moreover, A\u03b21-42 formed non-enveloped EV-A71 particle aggregates within a certain period and bound to the capsid protein VP1, which partially caused A\u03b21-42 to prevent viruses from infecting cells. Our findings unveiled that A\u03b21-42 effectively inhibited nonenveloped EV-A71 by targeting the early phase of an EV-A71 life cycle, thereby extending the potential function of A\u03b2 in other non-envelope viruses linked to infectious neurological diseases.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36162324": {"ArticleTitle": "Structural dynamics and catalytic modulations of A\u03b2 regulating enzymes as future outlook for Alzheimer's.", "AbstractText": "A\u03b2 cascade hypothesis being considered most evident event in AD pathology and even today it holds good.

Underwater endoscopic mucosal resection (UEMR) has emerged as an alternative method. There are few comparative studies between these techniques, especially evaluating recurrence. Then, the purpose of this trial was to compare CEMR and UEMR for the resection of colorectal lesions with respect to efficacy, safety and recurrence rate. Randomized controlled trial of UEMR versus CEMR for na\u00efve and non-pedunculated lesions measuring between 10 and 40 mm. The primary outcome was adenoma recurrence at 6 months after the resection. Secondary outcomes were technical success, en bloc resection and adverse events rates. Block randomization was used to assign patients. Tattooing was performed to facilitate localization of the scars and eventual recurrences. Endoscopic follow-up was scheduled at 6 months after the procedure. The sites of resections were examined with white light, Narrow-Band Imaging and conventional chromoscopy with indigo carmine followed by biopsies. One hundred and five patients with 120 lesions were included, with a mean size of 17.5 \u00b1 7.1 (SD) mm. Sixty-one lesions were resected underwater and 59 by CEMR. The groups were similar at baseline, regarding age, gender, average size, or histological type. Lesions in the proximal colon in the conventional group corresponded to 83% and in the UEMR group to 67.8% (p=0.073). There was no difference between groups regarding success rate (one failure in each group) and en bloc resection rate (60.6% UEMR vs 54.2% CEMR, p = 0.48). Intra-procedure bleeding was observed in five conventional resections (8.5%) and two UEMRs (3.3%) (p = 0.27). There was no perforation or delayed hemorrhage in both groups. Recurrence rate was higher in the CEMR arm (15%) than in UEMR (2%) (p=0.031). Therefore, the relative risk of 6-month recurrence rate in the CEMR group was 7.5 fold higher (95% CI - 0.98 to 58.20) with a NNT of 7.7 (95% CI - 40.33 to 4.22). The higher recurrence rate in CEMR group persisted only for lesions measuring 21-40mm (35.7 vs. 0%, p=0.04).

This study established a framework that unifies the processes of identifying a brain connectivity-based biomarker and mapping its abnormality level into a single numerical value, called a biomarker abnormality summarized from the identified connectivity (BASIC) score. A connectivity-based biomarker was extracted in the form of a connected component associated with disease progression. BASIC scores were constructed to maximize Kendall's rank correlation with the disease, considering the spatial autocorrelation between adjacent edges. Using functional connectivity networks, we validated the BASIC scores in various scenarios. Our proposed framework was successfully applied to construct connectivity-based biomarker scores associated with disease progression, characterized by two, three, and five stages of Alzheimer's disease, and reflected the continuity of brain alterations as the diseases advanced. The BASIC scores were not only sensitive to disease progression, but also specific to the trajectory of a particular disease. Moreover, this framework can be utilized when disease stages are measured on continuous scales, resulting in a notable prediction performance when applied to the prediction of the disease.

Early detection of altered synaptic transmission and insight into mechanisms causing early synaptic alterations would be valuable treatment strategies. This study aimed to investigate how whole-brain networks are influenced at pre- and early-plague stages of AD and if these manifestations are associated with concomitant cellular and synaptic deficits.\u00a0 METHODS: To this end, we used an established AD rat model (TgF344-AD) and employed resting state functional MRI and quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis, a method to detect recurrent spatiotemporal motifs of brain activity, in parallel with state-of-the-art immunohistochemistry in selected brain regions. At the pre-plaque stage, QPPs in TgF344-AD rats showed decreased activity of the basal forebrain (BFB) and the default mode-like network. Histological analyses revealed increased astrocyte abundance restricted to the BFB, in the absence of amyloid plaques, tauopathy, and alterations in a number of cholinergic, gaba-ergic, and glutamatergic synapses. During the early-plaque stage, when mild amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) accumulation was observed in the cortex and hippocampus, QPPs in the TgF344-AD rats normalized suggesting the activation of compensatory mechanisms during this early disease progression period. Interestingly, astrogliosis observed in the BFB at the pre-plaque stage was absent at the early-plaque stage. Moreover, altered excitatory/inhibitory balance was observed in cortical regions belonging to the default mode-like network. In wild-type rats, at both time points, peak activity in the BFB preceded peak activity in other brain regions-indicating its modulatory role during QPPs. However, this pattern was eliminated in TgF344-AD suggesting that alterations in BFB-directed neuromodulation have a pronounced impact in network function in AD. This study demonstrates the value of rsfMRI and advanced network analysis methods to detect early alterations in BFB function in AD, which could aid early diagnosis and intervention in AD.

The current work provides the first direct evidence that the mitochondrial metabolic switch 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17\u03b2HSD10) is expressed and active in murine astrocytes from different brain regions. While it is known that this protein is overexpressed in the brains of AD patients, we found that 17\u03b2HSD10 is also upregulated in astrocytes exposed to amyloidogenic and ischemic stress. Importantly, such catalytic overexpression of 17\u03b2HSD10 inhibits mitochondrial respiration during increased energy demand. This observation contrasts with what has been found in neuronal and cancer model systems, which suggests astrocyte-specific mechanisms mediated by the protein.

The main reason is hormonal senescence after menopause, a period characterized by a decline in estrogen levels. Since the effectiveness of drugs currently approved for the treatment of AD is limited, it is necessary to seek the development of new therapeutic strategies. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in AD patients and individuals with dementia in general. The supplementation of this vitamin in dementia patients might be an interesting approach for increasing the effectiveness of pre-existing medications for dementia treatment. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin D treatment associated with memantine and donepezil in female mice submitted to ovariectomy (OVX) for five months and subjected to a dementia animal model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated amyloid \u03b2eta (A\u03b21-42). For this purpose, Balb/c mice were divided into five experimental groups, which received 17\u202fdays of combined therapy with vitamin D, donepezil, and memantine. Then, animals were subjected to behavioral tests. OVX groups exhibited reduced levels of E2 in serum, which was not altered by the combined therapy. Higher levels of vitamin D3 were found in the OVX animals submitted to the triple-association treatment. Mice exposed to both OVX and the dementia animal model presented impairment in short and long-term spatial and habituation memories. Also, female mice exposed to A\u03b2 and OVX exhibited a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels, and an increase in tumor necrose factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) levels in the hippocampus. Besides, increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were observed, as well as a significant increase in immunoreactivity for GFAP, an astrocytes marker, in the hippocampus. Notably, triple-association treatment reversed the effects of the exposition of mice to A\u03b2 and OVX in the long-term spatial and habituation memories impairment, as well as reversed changes in TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, and GFAP immunoreactivity levels in the hippocampus of treated animals.

Various biological abnormalities have been identified in the mechanisms of hormone resistance such as changes in the estrogen receptor, mutations in the ESR1\u00a0gene, aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway or cell cycle deregulations. Historical strategies for circumventing this hormone resistance have been based on hormonal manipulation, on the development of new endocrine therapy such as fulvestrant (selective estrogen receptor inhibitor, SERD), on combinations of treatments such as everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor. This strategy combining endocrine therapy and targeted therapy has led to the development of combinations with CDK4/6\u00a0inhibitors which have now become a standard treatment in the hormone resistance phase.

Here, we report that coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 6 (CHCHD6), a core protein of the mammalian mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system, mechanistically connects these AD features through a circular feedback loop that lowers CHCHD6 and raises APP processing. In cellular and animal AD models and human AD brains, the APP intracellular domain fragment inhibits CHCHD6 transcription by binding its promoter. CHCHD6 and APP bind and stabilize one another. Reduced CHCHD6 enhances APP accumulation on mitochondria-associated ER membranes and accelerates APP processing, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cholesterol accumulation, promoting amyloid pathology. Compensation for CHCHD6 loss in an AD mouse model reduces AD-associated neuropathology and cognitive impairment. Thus, CHCHD6 connects APP processing and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.

Clonal and subclonal relationships between GP3 and GP5 lesions were assessed using genetically validated immunohistochemical assays for ERG, PTEN, and P53. 9/14 (64%) cases showed ERG reactivity in both GP3 and GP5 lesions. Only 1/14 (7%) cases showed a discordant pattern with ERG staining present only in GP3. PTEN expression was lost in 2/14 (14%) cases with perfect concordance between GP5 and GP3. P53 nuclear reactivity was present in 1/14 (7%) case in both GP5 and GP3.

This study included cognitively intact participants aged 60 to 90 years at baseline with annual follow-up from October 1997 to December 2020 (maximum follow-up of 22 years). During the follow-up, participants underwent brain autopsies. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to February 2022 using mixed-effect models. BMI was calculated using height and weight measured at baseline and follow-ups. Incident MCI and dementia were diagnosed following standard criteria. Neuropathological assessments (including global Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology) were performed for autopsies. A total of 1390 participants (mean [SD] age, 78.4 [6.5] years; 1063 female [76.5%]) were included in the study. In the analysis of BMI trajectories before MCI (n = 939), during the follow-up (median [IQR] duration, 6 [3-9] years), 371 participants (39.5%) developed MCI, of whom 88 (23.7%) progressed to dementia.

Our results showed that PAP mice and health mice had different structures of the bacterial communities in the gut. The abundances and diversities of the bacterial communities in health mice were higher than in PAP mice by metagenomics analysis.

Subgroup meta-analyses of four studies stratified by MHT formulations showed inverse associations with the risk of pancreatic cancer (women receiving estrogen-only MHT: RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.94; I2, 57%; estrogen plus progestin MHT: RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96; I2, 0%). Subgroup analysis defined by recency and duration of treatment did not reveal evidence of associations between MHT and pancreatic cancer risk. Conclusion This study found no association between the overall use of MHT and risk of pancreatic cancer. However, among four studies with data on MHT formulations, subgroup analysis showed a decreased risk of pancreatic cancer among users of estrogen-only and combined estrogen-progestin therapy. Owing to the inconsistent findings between our main and subgroup analyses, future studies stratified by MHT formulations are warranted.

In Alzheimer's disease, and other related tauopathies, the pattern of tau deposition follows a stereotypical progression between anatomically connected brain regions. Increasing evidence suggests that tau behaves in a \"prion-like\" manner, and that seeding and spreading of pathological tau drive progressive neurodegeneration. Although several advances have been made in recent years, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Since there are no effective therapies for any tauopathy, there is a growing need for reliable experimental models that would provide us with better knowledge and understanding of their etiology and identify novel molecular targets.

Drug therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, are effective treatments for NSCLC in clinics. However, most patients ultimately develop drug resistance, which is also the leading cause of treatment failure in cancer. To date, the mechanisms of drug resistance have yet to be fully elucidated, thus original strategies are developed to overcome this issue. Emerging studies have illustrated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) participate in the generation of therapeutic resistance in NSCLC. CircRNAs mediate the modulations of immune cells, cytokines, autophagy, ferroptosis and metabolism in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which play essential roles in the generation of drug resistance of NSCLC. More importantly, circRNAs function as miRNAs sponges to affect specific signaling pathways, directly leading to the generation of drug resistance. Consequently, this review highlights the mechanisms underlying the relationship between circRNAs and drug resistance in NSCLC.

Systematic literature searches of Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science research databases were conducted on 17 December 2022. Data from relevant studies were extracted and independently screened for quality using a tool for bias. Clinical utility was measured by clinicians' changes in diagnosis, diagnostic confidence and patient management (when available), after their examination of patients' CSF biomarkers. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by consideration of additional cost per patient and quality-adjusted life years. Searches identified 17 studies comprising 2090 patient participants and 593 clinicians. The meta-analysis revealed that clinicians' use of CSF biomarkers resulted in a pooled percentage change in diagnosis of 25% (95% CI 14 to 37), an increase in diagnostic confidence of 14% (95% CI 9 to 18) and a pooled proportion of patients whose management changed of 31% (95% CI 12 to 50). CSF biomarkers were deemed cost-effective, particularly in memory services, where pre-test AD prevalence is higher compared with a primary care setting. CSF biomarkers can be a helpful additional diagnostic tool for clinicians assessing patients with cognitive impairment.

LC accounts for 12\u202f% of the total cancer diagnosis and is among the most occurring malignancies in both genders. Radiotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy are the treatment options for LC. The obstacles faced by chemotherapy include faster elimination, affecting healthy cells, and poor targeting. The application of nanotechnology in drug delivery has gained profound value with the development of various nanoparticulate systems such as nanoparticles, liposomes etc. Some limitations exhibited by the conventional nanocarriers include leakage of the drug, and stability issues. In order to overcome these problems, approaches such as coating of the NPs and use of stimuli responsive nanocarriers have been used. These approaches also aid in boosting pre-existing properties and achieving organ restricted drug delivery. Stimuli responsive DDS (drug delivery systems) are those systems in which the drug is released or delivered via a stimulus. Due to the reason that cancer tissues exhibit characteristic pH, elevated enzyme levels, these sort of smart nanocarriers have found their application in targeting cancer. Various nanocarriers incorporating various molecules have also been formulated and tested against lung cancer.

Using brains from the Religious Order Study (ROS), this study compared measures of brain eicosanoid lipidome in older persons with AD dementia to age-matched controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI), stratified by APOE genotype. Lipidomic analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex demonstrated lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and DHA-derived neuroprotectin D1 (NPD-1) in persons with AD dementia, all of which associated with lower measures of cognitive function. A significant interaction was observed between carrying the APOE4 allele and higher levels of both pro-inflammatory lipids and pro-resolving eicosanoid lipids on measures of cognitive performance and on neuritic plaque burden. Furthermore, analysis of lipid metabolism pathways implicated activation of calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzymes.

Both point mutations (that alter the translated protein sequence) and synonymous mutations (that do not alter the translated protein sequence) are capable of affecting the splicing process. Synonymous mutations are known to affect gene expression via altering mRNA stability, mRNA secondary structure, splicing processes, and translational kinetics. In higher eukaryotes, precise splicing is regulated by three weakly conserved cis-elements, 5' and 3' splice sites and the branch site. Many other cis-acting elements (exonic/intronic splicing enhancers and silencers) and trans-acting splicing factors (serine and arginine-rich proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins) have also been found to enhance or suppress the splicing process. The appearance of synonymous mutations in cis-acting elements can alter the splicing process by changing the binding pattern of splicing factors to exonic splicing enhancers or silencer motifs. This results in exon skipping, intron retention, and various other forms of alternative splicing, eventually leading to the emergence of a wide range of diseases.

Proteostasis is fundamental to preserve physiological metabolic processes in the cell and it allow to respond to any given stimulus as the expression of components of the proteostasis network is customized according to the proteomic demands of different cellular environments. In conditions that promote unfolding/misfolding of proteins chaperones act as signaling molecules inducing extreme measures to either fix the problem or destroy unfolded proteins. When the chaperone machinery fails under pathological insults unfolded proteins induce the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) machinery. The activation of the UPR restores ER proteostasis primarily through the transcriptional remodeling of ER protein folding, trafficking, and degradation pathways, such as the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). If these mechanisms do not manage to clear the aberrant proteins, proteasome overload and become defective, and misfolded proteins may form aggregates thus extending the UPR mechanism. These aggregates are then attempted to be cleared by macroautophagy. Impaired proteostasis promote the accumulation of misfolded proteins that exacerbate the damage to chaperones, surveillance systems and/or degradative activities. Remarkably, the removal of toxic misfolded proteins is critical for all cells, but it is especially significant in neurons since these cannot be readily replaced. In neurons, the maintenance of efficient proteostasis is essential to healthy aging since the dysregulation of the proteostasis network can lead to neurodegenerative disease. Each of these brain pathologies is characterized by the repeated misfolding of one of more peculiar proteins, which evade both the protein folding machinery and cellular degradation mechanisms and begins to form aggregates that nucleate out into large fibrillar aggregates. In this chapter we describe the mechanisms, associated with faulty proteostasis, that promote the formation of protein aggregates, amyloid fibrils, intracellular, and extracellular inclusions in the most common nondegenerative disorders also referred to as protein misfolding disorders.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36306794": {"ArticleTitle": "Retraction Notice to: miR-221&222 Regulate TRAIL Resistance and Enhance Tumorigenicity through PTEN and TIMP3 Downregulation.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Cancer"}, "36088850": {"ArticleTitle": "Cognitive impairment is not uncommon in patients with biallelic RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion, but the expansion is rare in patients with cognitive disease.", "AbstractText": "The biallelic repeat expansion (AAGGG)exp in RFC1 causes cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS).

Previously, we showed that cachectic features in myotubes are provoked by a metabolic shift toward lactic fermentation. Our previous results led us to hyphotesise that increasing pyruvate concentration could impede the metabolic modifications responsible for induction of cachexia in myotubes. Here, we demonstrated that the addition of sodium pyruvate in conditioned media from CT26 colon cancer cells (CM CT26) prevents the onset of either phenotypic and metabolic cachectic features. Myotubes treated with CM CT26 containing sodium pyruvate show a phenotype similar to the healthy counterpart and display lactate production, oxygen consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity as control myotubes. The use of the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier inhibitor UK5099, highlights the importance of mitochondrial pyruvate amount in the prevention of cachexia. Indeed, UK5099-treated myotubes show cachectic features as those observed in myotubes treated with CM CT26. Finally, we found that sodium pyruvate is able to decrease STAT3 phosphorylation level, a signaling pathway involved in the induction of cachexia in myotubes.

However, semi-quantitative measures may potentially be affected by changes in blood flow, whereas quantitative measures such as binding potential (BPND) are not. For [18F]flortaucipir PET the sensitivity of SUVr for changes in blood flow has not been investigated yet. This is important, because [18F]flortaucipir PET is an important outcome measure in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore we compared semi-quantitative (SUVr) and quantitative (R1, BPND) parameters of longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir PET scans, and assessed their vulnerability to changes in blood flow. Subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; n = 38) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (n = 24) underwent baseline (BL) and 2-year follow-up (FU) dynamic [18F]flortaucipir PET scans. BPND and R1 were estimated using receptor parametric mapping (RPM) and SUVr(80-100min) was calculated. For each region-of-interest ((trans)entorhinal, limbic and neocortical) and parameter, %change was calculated. Regional SUVrs were compared to corresponding DVR (= BPND+1) using paired T-tests. Additionally, simulations were performed to model effects of (large(r)) flow changes on BPND and SUVr in different binding categories. Thereafter, %bias for SUVr with respect to underlying binding and flow were evaluated. Results in SCD and AD showed only minor differences between SUVr and BPND %change. R1 changes were small (+0.7% in SCD and -1.6% in AD). Simulations illustrated a variable %bias for SUVr depending on the underlying binding condition. Concluding, in line with established practices, SUVr provided an accurate estimate of specific binding for [18F]flortaucipir over a two-year follow-up during which changes in flow were small, also in AD patients. Notwithstanding, simulations showed that large(r) flow changes may potentially affect [18F]flortaucipir SUVr.

By identifying those at risk ideally before they have been diagnosed with breast and/or ovarian cancer, access to preventive measures, intensified screening and special therapeutic options can be obtained, and thus, prognosis can be altered beneficially. Therefore, a standardized screening and counseling process has been established in Germany under the aegis of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC). As one of these specialized clinics, the HBOC-Center at Charit\u00e9 offers genetic counseling as well as genetic analysis based on the GC-HBOC standards. This analysis aims first at depicting this process from screening through counseling to genetic analysis as well as the patient collective and second at correlating the results of genetic analysis performed. Thus, real-world data from an HBOC-Center with a substantial patient collective and a high frequency of pathogenic variants in various genes shall be presented. The data of 2531 people having been counseled at the HBOC-Center at Charit\u00e9 in 2016 and 2017 were analyzed in terms of patient and family history as well as pathogenic variants detected during genetic analysis with the TruRisk\u00ae gene panel when genetic analysis was conducted.

The following genes were included at time of research: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, NBN, and TP53. Genetic analysis was conducted in 59.8% of all cases meeting the criteria for genetic analysis and 286 pathogenic variants were detected among 278 (30.3%) counselees tested using the TruRisk\u00ae gene panel. These were primarily found in the genes BRCA1 (44.8%) and BRCA2 (28.3%) but also in CHEK2 (12.2%), ATM (5.6%) and PALB2 (3.5%).

These disorders are characterized by the gradual loss of a selectively vulnerable group of neurons. Due to the complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind neurodegeneration and despite enormous efforts and understanding of the occurrence and progression of NDs, there is still a lack of an effective treatment for such diseases. Therefore, the development of a new therapeutic strategy for NDs is an unmet clinical need. Various natural compounds extracted from medicinal plants or fruits have shown promising activities in treating different types of NDs by targeting multiple signaling pathways. Among natural entities, flavonoids have incited a rise in public and scientific interest in recent years because of their purported health-promoting effects. Dietary supplementation of flavonoids has been shown to mitigate the severity of NDs such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and dementia by their antioxidant effects. Naringenin is a citrus flavonoid that is known to possess numerous biological activities like antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, naringenin has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent that exerts preventive and curative effects on several neurological disorders. Increasing evidence has attained special attention on the variety of therapeutic targets along with complex signaling pathways of naringenin, which suggest its possible therapeutic applications in several NDs. Derived from the results of several pre-clinical research and considering the therapeutic effects of this compound, this review focuses on the potential role of naringenin as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The overall neuroprotective effects and different possible underlying mechanisms related to naringenin are discussed. In the light of substantial evidence for naringenin's neuroprotective efficacy in several experimental paradigms, this review suggests that this molecule should be investigated further as a viable candidate for the management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with an emphasis on mechanistic and clinical trials to determine its efficacy. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Naringenin is a flavanone, aglycone of Naringin, predominantly found in citrus fruits with a variety of pharmacological actions. Naringenin has been shown to exhibit remarkable therapeutic efficacy and has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of a variety of diseases such as various heart, liver, and metabolic disorders. Similarly, it has shown efficacy in neurodegenerative illnesses. Therefore, this review enables us to better understand the neuroprotective effects and different possible underlying mechanisms of naringenin.

We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of donepezil, a ChEI, on patients with MCI due to AD. We plan to recruit 78 participants (39 in each arm) with MCI who had amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)-positive results for this open-label study. To evaluate subtle differences, we will measure eye-tracking metrics and digital pen data while participants perform the simplified Rey Complex Figure (RCFT) and clock drawing tests. The primary outcome is a change in the ratio of the number of fixations (working space/perceptual space) performed using the simplified RCFT, from baseline to 12\u00a0weeks, as assessed using eye-tracking metrics. The secondary outcomes are changes in general cognition, clinical severity, activities of daily living, and visuospatial function assessed using standard rating scores and digital pen data. The analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be based on the difference in changes during follow-up between the donepezil and control groups using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as well as adjusting for baseline values. This study is designed to determine whether eye-tracking metrics can detect the effect of donepezil on visuospatial dysfunction more sensitively in patients with MCI.

We found that only B cells from old mice are inflammatory and induce in vitro secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 by T cells. In co-culture experiments, B cells from old mice showed a strong helper function on T cells from young mice, making them pro-inflammatory, and this effect is regulated by metabolic pathways, mainly anaerobic glycolysis, leading to increased RNA expression of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) and increased secretion of lactate. These results have indicated that lactate is a crucial player of the B cell-induced polarization of T cells. When we measured the effects of lactate on isolated CD4+ T cells from young mice, we found that lactate increases RNA expression of LDHA, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB activation. Moreover, lactate effects in culture can be abrogated in the presence of the specific inhibitor of LDHA, FX11.

Recent evidence suggests that HE is not only a disease of the liver and brain but is also related to the gut. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is well known to be associated with cirrhosis, but the relationship between SIBO and HE is unclear. We conducted this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association between SIBO and HE in cirrhotic patients. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of all studies on the association of SIBO and HE in cirrhotic patients using the PubMed and Embase electronic databases. Studies were screened, and relevant data were extracted and analysed. We calculated the number of cases of SIBO in patients with HE and controls. We then compared the prevalence of SIBO between the two groups to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Funnel plots were constructed to identify potential publication bias. Six studies with 414 participants (219 HE patients and 195 controls) met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of SIBO in cirrhotic patients with HE was significantly higher than that in those without HE. The combined OR was 4.43 (95% CI 1.73-11.32, P = 0.002). The heterogeneity was moderate (I 2 = 66%), and the funnel plot suggested no significant publication bias. Subgroup analysis showed that the OR was 1.95 (95% CI 0.63-6.09) in studies using the lactulose breath test (LBT) and 7.60 (95% CI 3.50-16.50) in studies using the glucose breath test (GBT). The prevalence of SIBO in cirrhotic patients was also related to the severity of liver disease. Our meta-analysis identified a strong association between SIBO and HE, and the risk of SIBO was 4.43 times higher among cirrhotic patients with HE than among those without HE. SIBO could be a predisposing factor for the development of HE in cirrhotic patients.

The structures of both compounds (1 and 2) were accurately confirmed with GC-MS analysis by comparison of the fragmentation pattern within the library of the instrument. Further, the NMR analysis was also used to supplement the structural evidence. Compound 1 was observed to be 4,22-cholestadien-3-one, while compound 2 was identified as stigmast-4-en-3-one. Both compounds were evaluated for anticholinesterase, COX/LOX inhibitions and antioxidant assays. Compound 1 exhibited the IC50 values of 20.29, 27.35, 10.70, 80.10 and 7.40 \u03bcg/mL against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, COX-2, COX-1 and 5-LOX, respectively.

The rate of postoperative infection was determined, and patient demographic characteristics, clinicopathologic factors, and prognostic factors for overall survival were analyzed. Of the 462 eligible patients who underwent curative pancreatectomy, postoperative infection occurred in 141 patients (31%), including 114 surgical site infections (25%), 50 remote infections (11%), and 23 combined infections (5%). Risk factors for postoperative infection included high body mass index, nondiabetes, and longer operation time.

The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to find hypoxia-related genes, and the stemness index (mRNAsi) was evaluated using the one-class logistic regression (OCLR) technique. Based on stemness-hypoxia-related genes (SHRGs), population subgroup categorization using NMF cluster analysis was carried out. The relationship between SHRGs and survival outcomes was determined using univariate Cox regression. The LASSO-Cox regression strategy was performed to investigate the quality and establish the classifier associated with prognosis. The main effect of risk scores on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its response to immune checkpoint drugs was also examined. Finally, qRT-PCR was performed to explore the expression and prognostic value of the signature in clinical samples. After identifying tumor stemness- and hypoxia-related genes through a series of bioinformatics analyses, we constructed a prognostic stratification model based on these SHRGs, which can be effectively applied to the prognostic classification of HCC patients and the prediction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) efficacy. Independent validation of the model in the ICGC cohort yielded good results. In addition, we also constructed hypoxic cell models in Herp3B and Huh7 cells to verify the expression of genes in the prognostic model and found that C7, CLEC1B, and CXCL6 were not only related to the tumor stemness but also related to hypoxia.

Neutrophils constitute significant compositions of malignancies and play key roles in tumor development. However, the role of senescent neutrophils in cancer progression is presently unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils display enhanced senescence in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The senescent neutrophils produce increased number of exosomes, which confer drug resistance to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, senescent neutrophils-derived exosomal piRNA-17560 enhances the expression of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in breast cancer cells. The upregulation of FTO further strengthens ZEB1 transcripts stability and expression by decreasing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, leading to chemoresistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells. Clinically, the level of exosomal piR-17560 correlates with poor chemotherapy response in patients with breast cancer. In addition, YTHDF2 is essential for the posttranscriptional regulation of ZEB1 by piRNA-17560/FTO signaling. Senescent neutrophils secret exosomal piR-17560 in a STAT3-dependent manner.

This was a retrospective analysis of the Million Veteran Program (MVP), a national, population-based cohort study of US military veterans conducted 2011-2021. Cox proportional hazards analyses tested for association of genetic and other risk factors (including self-reported race and ethnicity and family history) with age at death from prostate cancer, age at diagnosis of metastatic (nodal or distant) prostate cancer, and age at diagnosis of any prostate cancer. 590,750 male participants were included. Median age at last follow-up was 69 years. PHS290 was associated with fatal prostate cancer in the full cohort and for each racial and ethnic group (p<0.001). Comparing men in the highest 20% of PHS290 to those in the lowest 20% (based on percentiles from an independent training cohort), the hazard ratio for fatal prostate cancer was 4.42 [95%CI: 3.91-5.02].

Little is known about the extent to which targetable pathogenic mechanisms are shared among these seemingly diverse diseases. Translational control is critical for maintaining proteostasis during aging. Gaining control of the translation machinery is also crucial in the battle between viruses and their hosts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that overexpression of SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) robustly rescued neuromuscular degeneration and behavioral phenotypes in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These diseases share a common mechanism: the accumulation of aberrant protein species due to the stalling and collision of translating ribosomes, leading to proteostasis failure. Our genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that Nsp1 acted in a multipronged manner to resolve collided ribosomes, abort stalled translation, and remove faulty translation products causative of disease in these models, at least in part through the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, ribosome-associated quality-control factors, autophagy, and AKT signaling. Nsp1 exhibited exquisite specificity in its action, as it did not modify other neurodegenerative conditions not known to be associated with ribosome stalling. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of Nsp1 in manipulating host translation, which can be leveraged for combating age-related neurodegenerative diseases that are affecting millions of people worldwide and currently without effective treatment.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36194986": {"ArticleTitle": "p-Coumaric acid ameliorates cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease: The role of oxidative stress and inflammation.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most progressive form of neurodegenerative disease resulting in cognitive and non-cognitive deficits.

This ensures survival of transplanted human stem cell grafts and enables predictive efficacy testing. Immunosuppressive drugs derived from clinical protocols are frequently used but are often inconsistent and associated with toxic side effects. Here, using a molecular imaging approach, we show that immunosuppression targeting costimulatory molecules CD4 and CD40L enables robust survival of human xenografts in mouse brain, as compared to conventional tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Human neural stem cells were modified to express green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase. Cells were implanted in the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus and viability assessed by non-invasive bioluminescent imaging. Cell survival was assessed using traditional pharmacologic immunosuppression as compared to monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4 and CD40L. This paradigm was also implemented in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Graft rejection occurs within 7 days in non-immunosuppressed mice and within 14 days in mice on a traditional regimen. The addition of dual monoclonal antibody immunosuppression extends graft survival past 7 weeks (p < .001) on initial studies. We confirm dual monoclonal antibody treatment is superior to either antibody alone (p < .001). Finally, we demonstrate robust xenograft survival at multiple cell doses up to 6 months in both C57BL/6J mice and a transgenic Alzheimer's disease model (p < .001).

Importantly, DJExpress runs on an average laptop computer and provides a set of interactive and intuitive visualization formats. In contrast to most existing pipelines, DJExpress can handle both annotated and de novo identified splice junctions, thereby allowing the quantification of novel splice events. Moreover, DJExpress offers a web-compatible graphical interface allowing the analysis of user-provided data as well as the visualization of splice events within our custom database of differential junction expression in cancer (DJEC DB). DJEC DB includes not only healthy and tumor tissue junction expression data from TCGA and GTEx repositories but also cancer cell line data from the DepMap project. The integration of DepMap functional genomics data sets allows association of junction expression with molecular features such as gene dependencies and drug response profiles. This facilitates identification of cancer cell models for specific splicing alterations that can then be used for functional characterization in the lab.

To determine whether sequential two-step culture protocols can improve the efficiency of rat in vitro spermatogenesis. Rat prepubertal testicular tissues were cultured on agarose gels with either a one-step or two-step protocol with or without PDMS ceiling chips. The progression of spermatogenesis, germ/Sertoli cell ratio, cell proliferation, seminiferous tubule area and intratubular cell density were assessed by histological and immunohistochemical analyses. TUNEL assays and PNA lectin labeling were performed to analyze the DNA integrity and differentiation step of in vitro-produced spermatids. Sequential two-step protocols allowed the production of spermatids with a higher efficiency compared with the one-step culture protocol. However, the efficiency was low, as less than 1.5% of tubules contained spermatids. Most of the in vitro-produced spermatids contained unfragmented DNA and were at an early step of differentiation. Rare elongating spermatids could be detected in the cultured explants. Although complete in vitro spermatogenesis could not be obtained with PDMS ceiling chips, entry into meiosis was promoted in one-step organotypic cultures. Complete in vitro meiosis and the beginning of the elongation phase of spermiogenesis were obtained in a rat model using sequential culture methods. Because of their low efficiency, further work will be necessary to identify the culture conditions allowing the completion of spermiogenesis.

Accumulating evidence suggests that proteopathic tau can seed tau aggregation in a prion-like fashion in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of tau seeding activity could provide a potential therapeutic opportunity to block the propagation of tau pathology in AD and related tauopathies. In the present study, we investigated the role of 77G7, a monoclonal tau antibody to the microtubule-binding repeats, in repressing the seeding activity of proteopathic tau. We found that 77G7 had a higher affinity toward aggregated pathological tau fractions than un-aggregated tau derived from AD brain. 77G7 inhibited the internalization of tau aggregates by cells, blocked AD O-tau to capture normal tau, and to seed tau aggregation in vitro and in cultured cells. Tau pathology induced by hippocampal injection of AD O-tau in 3xTg-AD mice was suppressed by mixing 77G7 with AD O-tau. Intravenous administration of 77G7 ameliorated site-specific hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by AD O-tau in the hippocampi of Tg/hTau mice.

Neuronal death leads to release of tau proteins which can become dephosphorylated, rephosphorylated or hyperphosphorylated in the setting of ischemia, possibly leading to formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, a potential synergistic effect between development of tauopathy and cerebrovascular lesion burden may contribute to cognitive decline after stroke. We explored the spatial and temporal distribution of neurofibrillary tangles after ischemic stroke in vivo by using 18F-MK-6240 positron emission tomography (PET). We included patients with a first ischemic stroke to undergo longitudinal 18F-MK-6240 PET/MR within 2 to 4 weeks and 6 months after stroke. For cross-sectional analyses, we also included age-matched healthy controls. We delineated 5 volumes-of-interest based on T2 FLAIR and T1 MR data: the ischemic lesion, 3 consecutive peri-ischemic areas and the remaining ipsilesional hemisphere. We performed region-based voxel-wise partial volume correction on the PET data and calculated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) with the cerebellum as reference region. We did not quantify PET scans of patients within the first month after stroke (n = 17; median age 73 years [IQR: 62-82]) since the signal intensity was influenced by blood brain barrier breakdown hampering a reliable data analysis. At 6 months after the event (n = 13; median age 71 years [IQR: 60-79]), 18F-MK-6240 SUVR was increased in the ischemic lesion compared to 20 age-matched healthy controls (median age 71.5 years [IQR: 66-76]; ratiolesion/controls = 1.62\u00b10.54; one-sample t-test: p = 0.0015) and gradually decreased in the surrounding tissue (one-way within-subject ANOVA(F(1.2, 14.8) = 18.0, p = 0.00043).

The hypometabolic state associated with chronic thiamine insufficiency (TI) has been demonstrated to be a contributor towards the development of amyloid plaque deposition and neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying TI induced AD pathology is still unresolved. Previously, we have established that TI stabilizes the metabolic stress transcriptional factor, Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). Utilizing neuronal hippocampal cells (HT22), TI-induced HIF1\u03b1 activation triggered the amyloidogenic cascade through transcriptional expression and increased activity of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1). Knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of HIF1\u03b1 during TI significantly reduced BACE1 and C-terminal Fragment of 99 amino acids (C99) formation. TI also increased the expression of the HIF1\u03b1 regulated pro-apoptotic protein, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19\u00a0kDa protein-interacting protein (BNIP3). Correspondingly, cell toxicity during TI conditions was significantly reduced with HIF1\u03b1 and BNIP3 knockdown. The role of BNIP3 in TI-mediated toxicity was further highlighted by localization of dimeric BNIP3 into the mitochondria and nuclear accumulation of Endonuclease G. Subsequently, TI decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced chromatin fragmentation. However, cell toxicity via the HIF1\u03b1/BNIP3 cascade required TI induced oxidative stress. HIF1\u03b1, BACE1 and BNIP3 expression was induced in 3xTg-AD mice after TI and administration with the HIF1\u03b1 inhibitor YC1 significantly attenuated HIF1\u03b1 and target genes levels in vivo.

The individual level SNP-QT signals are high dimensional and typically have small effect sizes, making them hard to be detected and replicated. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a new approach that identifies high-level imaging genetic associations through applying multigraph clustering to the SNP-QT association maps. Given an SNP set and a brain QT set, the association between each SNP and each QT is evaluated using a linear regression model. Based on the resulting SNP-QT association map, five SNP-SNP similarity networks (or graphs) are created using five different scoring functions, respectively. Multigraph clustering is applied to these networks to identify SNP clusters with similar association patterns with all the brain QTs. After that, functional annotation is performed for each identified SNP cluster and its corresponding brain association pattern. We applied this pipeline to an AD imaging genetic study, which yielded promising results. For example, in an association study between 54 AD SNPs and 116 amyloid QTs, we identified two SNP clusters with one responsible for amyloid beta clearances and the other regulating amyloid beta formation.

They have a critical role in brain maintenance. Microglia constantly scavenge various waste materials in the brain including damaged or apoptotic neurons and A\u03b2. Through phagocytosis of A\u03b2, microglia prevent the accumulation of A\u03b2 plaque in the brain. However, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, chronic exposure to A\u03b2 makes microglia to become exhausted, which reduces their phagocytic activity against A\u03b2. Since microglia play an important role in A\u03b2 clearance, enhancing microglial phagocytic activity against A\u03b2 is a promising target for AD treatment. Therefore, there is a great need for therapeutic candidate that enhances microglial A\u03b2 clearance while inhibiting microglia's pathogenic properties. In vivo studies were conducted with 5xFAD AD model mice by treating gossypetin for 13 weeks through intragastric administration. Their spatial learning and memory were evaluated through behavior tests such as Y-maze and Morris Water Maze test. Hippocampus and cortex were acquired from the sacrificed mice, and they were used for histological and biochemical analysis. Also, mouse tissues were dissociated into single cells for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Transcriptome of microglial population was analyzed. Mouse primary microglia and BV2 mouse microglial cell line were cultured and treated with fluorescent recombinant A\u03b2 to evaluate whether their phagocytic activity is affected by gossypetin. Gossypetin treatment improved the spatial learning and memory of 5xFAD by decreasing A\u03b2 deposition in the hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD. Gossypetin induced transcriptomic modulations in various microglial subpopulations, including disease-associated microglia. Gossypetin enhanced phagocytic activity of microglia while decreasing their gliosis. Gossypetin also increased MHC II+ microglial population.

Moreover, few studies record data on cause of death. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between conventional cardiac dosimetric parameters and death with cardiac causes using data from the UK national cause of death registry. Data on cancer diagnosis, treatment and cause of death following radical lung cancer radiotherapy were obtained from Public Health England for all patients treated at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust between 1/1/10 and 31/12/16. Individuals with metastatic disease and those who received multiple courses of thoracic radiotherapy where excluded. All patients who received > 45Gy in 20 fractions were included. Cardiac cause of death was defined as the following ICD-10 codes on death certificate: I20-I25; I30-I32; I34-I37; I40-I52. Cardiac V5Gy, V30Gy, V50Gy and mean heart dose (MHD) were extracted. Cumulative incidence of death with cardiac causes were plotted for each cardiac dosimetric parameter. Multi-variable Fine and Gray competing risk analysis was used to model predictors for cardiac death with non-cardiac death as a competing risk. Cardiac dosimetric parameters were available for 967 individuals, 110 died with a cardiac cause (11.4%). Patients with a cardiac comorbidity had an increased risk of death with a cardiac cause compared with those without a cardiac comorbidity (2-year cumulative incidence 21.3% v 6.2%, p<0.001). In patients with a pre-existing cardiac comorbidity, heart V30Gy \u2265 15% was associated with higher cumulative incidence of death with a cardiac cause compared to patients with heart V30Gy <15% (2-year rate 25.8% v 17.3%, p=0.05).

Current treatment strategies primarily involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, determined by TNM stages, histologic types, and genetic profiles. Plenty of studies have been trying to identify robust prognostic gene expression signatures. Even for high performance signatures, they usually have few shared genes. This is not totally unexpected, since a prognostic signature is associated with patient survival and may contain no upstream regulators. Identification of master regulators driving disease progression is a vital step to understand underlying molecular mechanisms and develop new treatments. Methods: In this study, we have utilized a robust workflow to identify potential master regulators that drive poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. This workflow takes gene expression signatures that are associated with poor survival of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR-TKI resistance, and responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors, respectively, and identifies recurrent master regulators from seven public gene expression datasets by a regulatory network-based approach. Results: We have found that majority of the master regulators driving poor prognosis in early stage LUAD are cell-cycle related according to Gene Ontology annotation. However, they were demonstrated experimentally to promote a spectrum of processes such as tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Master regulators predicted from EGFR-TKI resistance signature and the EMT pathway signature are largely shared, which suggests that EMT pathway functions as a hub and interact with other pathways such as hypoxia, angiogenesis, TNF-\u03b1 signaling, inflammation, TNF-\u03b2 signaling, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways. Master regulators that repress immunotherapy are enriched with MYC targets, E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, and mTOR signaling.

In protein-coding sequences STRs primarily encode disorder-promoting amino acids and are often located in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). STRs are frequently studied in the scope of microsatellite instability (MSI) in cancer, with little focus on the connection between protein STRs and IDRs. We believe, however, that this relationship should be explicitly included when ascertaining STR functionality in cancer. Here we explore this notion using all canonical human proteins from SwissProt, wherein we detected 3,699 STRs. Over 80% of these consisted completely of disorder promoting amino acids. 62.1% of amino acids in STR sequences were predicted to also be in an IDR, compared to 14.2% for non-repeat sequences. Over-representation analysis showed STR-containing proteins to be primarily located in the nucleus where they perform protein- and nucleotide-binding functions and regulate gene expression. They were also enriched in cancer-related signaling pathways. Furthermore, we found enrichments of STR-containing proteins among those correlated with patient survival for cancers derived from eight different anatomical sites. Intriguingly, several of these cancer types are not known to have a MSI-high (MSI-H) phenotype, suggesting that protein STRs play a role in cancer pathology in non MSI-H settings. Their intrinsic link with IDRs could therefore be an attractive topic of future research to further explore the role of STRs and IDRs in cancer.

The effects of paclitaxel on the viability of hAECs were evaluated to find an appropriate loading period. The possible mechanism of hAECs paclitaxel resistance was assessed using verapamil. Afterward, the loading and releasing efficacy of primed hAECs were evaluated by HPLC. The anti-neoplastic effects and apoptosis as possible mechanism of conditioned media of paclitaxel-loaded hAECs were assessed on breast and cervical cancer cell lines. hAECs are highly resistant to cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel in 24\u00a0h. Evaluating the role of P-glycoproteins in hAECs resistance showed that they do not participate in hAECs resistance. The HPLC demonstrated that hAECs uptake/release paclitaxel with optimum efficacy in 8000\u00a0ng/ml treatment. Assessing the anti-proliferative effect of primed hAECs condition media on cancer cells showed that the secretome induced 3.3- and 4.8-times more potent effects on MCF-7 and HeLa, respectively, and enhanced the apoptosis process. These results suggest that hAECs could possibly be used as a drug delivery system for cancer treatment. Besides, inherent anticancer effects of hAECs were preserved during the modification process.

Physiologically, it aims at removing damaged or aged erythrocytes from circulation. A plethora of diseases are associated with enhanced eryptosis, including metabolic diseases, cardiovascular pathology, renal and hepatic diseases, hematological disorders, systemic autoimmune pathology, and cancer. This makes eryptosis and eryptosis-regulating signaling pathways a target for therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the eryptotic signaling machinery containing several protein kinases and its small molecular inhibitors with a special emphasis on casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1), a serine/threonine protein kinase with a broad spectrum of activity. In this review article, we provide a critical analysis of the regulatory role of CK1\u03b1 in eryptosis, highlight triggers of CK1\u03b1-mediated suicidal death of red blood cells, cover the knowledge gaps in understanding CK1\u03b1-driven eryptosis and discover the opportunity of CK1\u03b1-targeted pharmacological modulation of eryptosis.

It is a rare peri-zygotic mutational event, previously reported to be seen once in every 12,000 individuals referred for genome-wide chromosomal microarray analysis due to congenital abnormalities. These rare families provide a unique opportunity to understand the genetic factors of peri-zygotic genome instability and the impact of dnCNV on human diseases. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), array-based comparative genomic hybridization, short- and long-read genome sequencing (GS) were performed on the newly identified MdnCNV family to identify de novo mutations including dnCNVs, de novo single-nucleotide variants (dnSNVs), and indels. Short-read GS was performed on four previously published MdnCNV families for dnSNV analysis. Trio-based rare variant analysis was performed on the newly identified individual and four previously published MdnCNV families to identify potential genetic etiologies contributing to the peri-zygotic genomic instability. Lin semantic similarity scores informed quantitative human phenotype ontology analysis on three MdnCNV families to identify gene(s) driving or contributing to the clinical phenotype. In the newly identified MdnCNV case, we revealed eight de novo tandem duplications, each\u2009~\u20091\u00a0Mb, with microhomology at 6/8 breakpoint junctions. Enrichment of de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNV; 6/79) and de novo indels (1/12) was found within 4\u00a0Mb of the dnCNV genomic regions. An elevated post-zygotic SNV mutation rate was observed in MdnCNV families. Maternal rare variant analyses identified three genes in distinct families that may contribute to the MdnCNV phenomenon. Phenotype analysis suggests that gene(s) within dnCNV regions contribute to the observed proband phenotype in 3/3 cases. CNVs in two cases, a contiguous gene\u00a0duplication encompassing PMP22 and RAI1 and another duplication affecting NSD1 and SMARCC2, contribute to the clinically observed phenotypic manifestations. Characteristic features of dnCNVs reported here are consistent with a microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR)-driven mechanism during the peri-zygotic period. Maternal genetic variants in DNA repair genes potentially contribute to peri-zygotic genomic instability. Variable phenotypic features were observed across a cohort of three MdnCNV probands, and computational quantitative phenotyping revealed that two out of three had evidence for the contribution of more than one genetic locus to the proband's phenotype supporting the hypothesis of de novo multilocus pathogenic variation (MPV) in those families.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36304274": {"ArticleTitle": "Assessing equivalent and inverse change in genes between diverse experiments.", "AbstractText": "Background: It is important to identify when two exposures impact a molecular marker (e.g., a gene's expression) in similar ways, for example, to learn that a new drug has a similar effect to an existing drug. Currently, statistically robust approaches for making comparisons of equivalence of effect sizes obtained from two independently run treatment vs. control comparisons have not been developed. Results: Here, we propose two approaches for evaluating the question of equivalence between effect sizes of two independent studies: a bootstrap test of the Equivalent Change Index (ECI), which we previously developed, and performing Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) on the difference in log-fold changes directly. The ECI of a gene is computed by taking the ratio of the effect size estimates obtained from the two different studies, weighted by the maximum of the two p-values and giving it a sign indicating if the effects are in the same or opposite directions, whereas TOST is a test of whether the difference in log-fold changes lies outside a region of equivalence. We used a series of simulation studies to compare the two tests on the basis of sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and F1-score. We found that TOST is not efficient for identifying equivalently changed gene expression values (F1-score = 0) because it is too conservative, while the ECI bootstrap test shows good performance (F1-score = 0.95). Furthermore, applying the ECI bootstrap test and TOST to publicly available microarray expression data from pancreatic cancer showed that, while TOST was not able to identify any equivalently or inversely changed genes, the ECI bootstrap test identified genes associated with pancreatic cancer. Additionally, when investigating publicly available RNAseq data of smoking vs. vaping, no equivalently changed genes were identified by TOST, but ECI bootstrap test identified genes associated with smoking. Conclusion: A bootstrap test of the ECI is a promising new statistical approach for determining if two diverse studies show similarity in the differential expression of genes and can help to identify genes which are similarly influenced by a specific treatment or exposure.

The Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) algorithm was first applied using a Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation protocol to a dataset comprising DLB and AD cases.

The various diagnostic classifiers generated by this process had high accuracy over the whole dataset (mean accuracy of 94%). The mean accuracy in classifying their out-of-sample case was 80.5%. Every classifier generated consisted of very simple structure, each using 1-2 classification rules and 1-3 data features. As a group, the classifiers were heterogeneous and used several different data features. In particular, some of the classifiers used very simple and inexpensive diagnostic features, yet with high diagnostic accuracy.

An antibody targeting A\u03b2 (aducanumab) was approved as an AD treatment; however, some A\u03b2 antibodies have been reported to accelerate, instead of ameliorating, cognitive decline in individuals with AD. Using conditional APP mutations in human neurons for perfect isogenic controls and translational relevance, we found that the APP-Swedish mutation in familial AD increased synapse numbers and synaptic transmission, whereas the APP deletion decreased synapse numbers and synaptic transmission. Inhibition of BACE1, the protease that initiates A\u03b2 production from APP, lowered synapse numbers, suppressed synaptic transmission in wild-type neurons, and occluded the phenotype of APP-Swedish-mutant neurons. Modest elevations of A\u03b2, conversely, elevated synapse numbers and synaptic transmission. Thus, the familial AD-linked APP-Swedish mutation under physiologically relevant conditions increased synaptic connectivity in human neurons via a modestly enhanced production of A\u03b2. These data are consistent with the relative inefficacy of BACE1 and anti-A\u03b2 treatments in AD and the chronic nature of AD pathogenesis, suggesting that AD pathogenesis is not simply caused by overproduction of toxic A\u03b2 but rather by a long-term effect of elevated A\u03b2 concentrations.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36307178": {"ArticleTitle": "Rates of repeated colonoscopies to clean the colon from low-risk and high-risk adenomas: results from the EPoS trials.", "AbstractText": "High-quality colonoscopy (adequate bowel preparation, whole-colon visualisation and removal of all neoplastic polyps) is a prerequisite to start polyp surveillance, and is ideally achieved in one colonoscopy.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are one of the key components of TME that play important roles in immunoregulation and therapy resistance. CSCs suppress CD8+ T cell infiltration, and promote recruitment of type 2 macrophages (M2) and the activity of type 2 neutrophils (N2). There is a positive association between CSC expansion with high PD-L1 expression in TME, and the expression of PD-L1 is higher in CSCs than cancer cells. PD-L1 expression in metastatic cancer cells induces a dedifferentiation program through stimulating an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) profile, thereby replenishing CSC proportion inside tumor.

Specifically, we regressed age with volumetric brain features using machine learning to construct the brain age model, and model-agnostic Shapley values were calculated to attribute regional brain aging for each subject's age estimation, forming the brain age vector.

Machine learning methods were adopted to examine the discriminability of the brain age vector in early disease screening, compared with the other two brain aging metrics (single brain age gap, regional brain age gaps) and brain volumes. Results showed that the proposed brain age vector accurately reflected disorder-specific abnormal aging patterns related to the medial temporal and the striatum for prodromal AD (sMCI vs. pMCI) and PD (healthy controls [HC] vs. prodromal PD), respectively, and demonstrated outstanding performance in early disease screening, with area under the curves of 83.39% and 72.28% in detecting pMCI and prodromal PD, respectively.

Loss of PTEN leads to pronounced accumulation of mature IL-17-producing innate-like T cells in the thymus. IL-23 is essential for their accumulation, and ablation of IL-23 or IL-17 signalling rectifies the reduced survival of female PTEN-haploinsufficient mice that model human patients with PTEN mutations. Single-cell transcriptome and network analyses revealed the dynamic regulation of PTEN, mTOR and metabolic activities that accompanied type-17 cell programming. Furthermore, deletion of mTORC1 or mTORC2 blocks PTEN loss-driven type-17 cell accumulation, and this is further shaped by the Foxo1 and Stat3 pathways.

Consecutive patients who underwent radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for resectable pancreatic cancer in a single high-volume center during a 7-year period were included retrospectively. Both short- and long-term effects of PAD were compared between the PAD group and the no PAD group. Then, the PAD group was divided into the non-metastatic para-aortic lymph node (PALN-) group and the metastatic PALN (PALN+) group to further analyze the prognosis of PALN+. Of the 909 included patients, 280 (30.8%) underwent PAD during pancreaticoduodenectomy. The PAD group had a higher rate of intra-abdominal infection compared with the no PAD group (28.6% vs. 20.7%, P = 0.009) but no differences were found in the incidence of other complications. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were also comparable between the two groups. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with PALN+ had a worse OS than patients in the PALN- group (median of 14 vs. 20 months, P = 0.048). Multivariate Cox regression analysis further revealed that PALN+ was an independent adverse predictor of OS (hazard ratio: 1.70, P = 0.007).

Data from other centers is lacking, so here we analyzed safety and pilot real-world short-term results of TPS from the first center in Germany. To gain information about effects in different stages, patients with not only mild but also moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's were analyzed. A total of 11 patients were retrospectively examined for cognitive and emotional function before and after the first stimulation series. The effect was assessed using several neuropsychological tests [Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), including the ADAS cognitive score (ADAS Cog) and ADAS affective scores, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] including in comparison between the groups of mild-to-severe patients. Moreover, subjective improvement of symptom severity, potential effects on depressive symptoms, and side effects were analyzed using Numeric Rating Scales (NRS). Side effects were rare (in 4% of sessions) with moderate subjective severity and only transient. Patients significantly improved in the ADAS and ADAS Cog, while there was no significant effect in MMSE and MoCA. Patients' self-reported symptom severity improved significantly. The depressive symptoms measured in an ADAS subscale also improved significantly. Statistical data analyses revealed no significant correlation of clinical improvement with baseline symptom severity. TPS might be a safe and promising add-on therapy for Alzheimer's, even for moderate-to-severe patients.

Many factors affect the onset and development of AD, but specific mechanisms underlying the disease are unclear. Most studies investigating AD have focused on neurons and the gray matter in the central nervous system (CNS) but have not led to effective treatments. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on the white matter (WM). Magnetic resonance imaging and pathology studies have shown different degrees of WM abnormality during the progression of AD. Myelin sheaths, the main component of WM in the CNS, wrap and insulate axons to ensure conduction of the rapid action potential and axonal integrity. WM damage is characterized by progressive degeneration of axons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and myelin in one or more areas of the CNS. The contributions of OLs to AD progression have, until recently, been largely overlooked. OLs are integral to myelin production, and the proliferation and differentiation of OLs, an early characteristic of AD, provide a promising target for preclinical diagnosis and treatment. However, despite some progress, the key mechanisms underlying the contributions of OLs to AD remain unclear. Given the heavy burden of medical treatment, a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD is vital.

Determining MCI, however, may be variable and subject to disagreement. Adjudication procedures may improve the reliability of these determinations. We report the performance of an adjudication committee for an AD prevention trial. The TOMMORROW prevention trial selected cognitively normal participants at increased genetic risk for AD and randomized them to low-dose pioglitazone or placebo treatment. When adjudication criteria were triggered, a participant's clinical information was randomly assigned to a three-member panel of a six-member independent adjudication committee. Determination of whether or not a participant reached MCI due to AD or AD dementia proceeded through up to three review stages - independent review, collaborative review, and full committee review - requiring a unanimous decision and ratification by the chair. Of 3494 participants randomized, the committee adjudicated on 648 cases from 386 participants, resulting in 96 primary endpoint events. Most participants had cases that were adjudicated once (n = 235, 60.9%); the rest had cases that were adjudicated multiple times. Cases were evenly distributed among the eight possible three-member panels. Most adjudicated cases (485/648, 74.8%) were decided within the independent review (stage 1); 14.0% required broader collaborative review (stage 2), and 11.1% needed full committee discussion (stage 3).

The adjudication process was designed to provide independent, consistent determinations of the trial endpoints. These outcomes demonstrated the extent of uncertainty among trial investigators and agreement between adjudicators when the transition to MCI due to AD was prospectively assessed.

We tested different PPI databases and compared the performance of the GNN models to baseline models using classical machine learning techniques, as well as randomized networks and input datasets. The overall results showed that GNNs could not outperform a baseline predictor only using the APOE gene, suggesting that missense variants are not sufficient to explain disease risk beyond the APOE status.

Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment.

to improve outcomes in rare neurological diseases has increased hope among people with lived experiences and their carers. Nevertheless, gene, somatic cell\u00a0and other advanced neurotherapeutic interventions carry significant risks. Rare disease patient organizations (RDPOs) may enhance patient experiences, inform expectations\u00a0and promote health literacy. However, their perspectives are understudied in paediatric neurology. If advanced neurotherapeutics is to optimize RDPO contributions, it demands further insights into their roles, interactions\u00a0and support needs. We used a mixed-methodology approach, interviewing 20 RDPO leaders representing paediatric rare neurological diseases\u00a0and following them up with two online surveys featuring closed and open-ended questions on advanced neurotherapeutics (19/20) and negative mood states (17/20). Qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using thematic discourse analysis and basic descriptive statistics, respectively. Leaders perceived their roles to be targeted at educational provision (20/20), community preparation for advanced neurotherapeutic clinical trials (19/20), information simplification (19/20)\u00a0and focused research pursuits (20/20). Although most leaders perceived the benefits of collaboration between stakeholders, some cited challenges around collaborative engagement under the following subthemes: conflicts of interest, competition\u00a0and logistical difficulties. Regarding neurotherapeutics, RDPO leaders identified support needs centred on information provision, valuing access to clinician experts and highlighting a demand for co-developed, centralized, high-level\u00a0and understandable, resources that may improve information exchange. Leaders perceived a need for psychosocial support within themselves and their communities, proposing that this would facilitate informed decision-making, reduce associated psychological vulnerabilities\u00a0and maintain hope throughout neurotherapeutic development. This study provides insights into RDPO research activities, interactions\u00a0and resource needs. It reveals a demand for collaboration guidelines, central information resources\u00a0and psychosocial supports that may address unmet needs and assist RDPOs in their advocacy. In this study, RDPO leaders were interviewed and surveyed to examine their perspectives and roles in advanced neurotherapeutic development.

Memory clinic patients were recruited from Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden (n=155). Diurnal cortisol patterns were assessed using five measures: awakening levels, cortisol awakening response, bedtime levels, the ratio of awakening to bedtime levels (AM/PM ratio) and total daily output. Cognition was measured in five domains: memory, working memory, processing speed, perceptual reasoning and overall cognition. AD biomarkers A\u03b242, total tau and phosphorylated tau were assessed from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cognition was measured at follow-up (average 32 months) in a subsample of participants (n=57). In assessing the associations between cortisol and cognition, higher awakening cortisol levels were associated with greater processing speed at baseline. No relationship was found between diurnal cortisol patterns and change in cognition over time or CSF AD biomarkers in the total sample. After stratification by CSF A\u03b242 levels, higher awakening cortisol levels were associated with worse memory performance in amyloid-positive participants. In amyloid-negative participants, higher bedtime cortisol levels and a lower AM/PM ratio were associated with lower overall cognition, greater awakening cortisol levels were associated with better processing speed, and a higher AM/PM ratio was associated with better perceptual reasoning. Additionally, higher awakening cortisol levels were associated with lower CSF A\u03b242 levels in amyloid-positive participants, while higher bedtime cortisol levels and a lower AM/PM ratio were associated with higher CSF total tau in amyloid-negative participants. Our findings suggest that diurnal cortisol patterns are associated with cognitive function and provide new insights into the association between diurnal cortisol patterns and AD-related CSF biomarkers.

To explore different neuroplasticity pathways modulated by aerobic and strength training, determine whether signaling pathways overlapped for each specific training method (aerobic and strength training), and evaluate whether there is a functional relationship between APOE and APP gene expression with aerobic training modulated by BDNF; and strength training modulated by IGF-1. An in silico analysis was performed to analyze the connection between exercise types and neuroplasticity as a protective factor in AD. The platform provides a protein-protein interaction network translated into known and predicted interactions. A score\u00a0>\u00a00.70 was determined as high confidence and the network was considered significant when the Protein-Protein Interaction Enrichment was <0.01. Multiple functional associations considered significant between the analyzed proteins. The results of our gene network model support that exercise, both aerobic and strength, can modulate genes that affect hippocampal neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, which may delay cognitive decline and Alzheimer's related symptoms.

In silico data mining and immunohistochemistry analysis of primary tumors indicate overexpression of the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in human PDAC tumors. Elevated VIP levels are also present in PDAC patient plasma and supernatants of cultured PDAC cells. Furthermore, T cells up-regulate VIP receptors after activation, identifying the VIP signaling pathway as a potential target to enhance T cell function. In mouse PDAC models, VIP-R antagonist peptides synergize with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in improving T cell recruitment into the tumors, activation of tumor-antigen-specific T cells, and inhibition of T cell exhaustion. In contrast to the limited single-agent activity of anti-PD1 antibodies or VIP-R antagonist peptides, combining both therapies eliminate tumors in up to 40% of animals.

Finally, the hybrid prototype was designed. All selected molecules showed interactions with their respective target enzymes. Derivation of the pharmacophoric pattern from molecules that interacted with the AChE enzyme resulted in 3 pharmacophoric regions: an aromatic ring, an electron-acceptor region and a hydrophobic region. The molecules showed good pharmacokinetic and toxicological results, showing no warnings of mutagenicity and/or carcinogenicity.

Delivery of biotherapeutics to the brain can be enabled through receptor-mediated transcytosis via proteins such as the transferrin receptor, although limitations such as the ability to use Fc-mediated effector function to clear pathogenic targets can introduce safety liabilities. Hence, novel delivery approaches with alternative clearance mechanisms are warranted. Binders that optimized transport across the BBB, known as transcytosis-enabling modules (TEMs), were identified using a combination of antibody discovery techniques and pharmacokinetic analyses. Functional activity of TEMs were subsequently evaluated by imaging for the ability of myeloid cells to phagocytose target proteins and cells. We demonstrated significantly enhanced brain exposure of therapeutic antibodies using optimal transferrin receptor or CD98 TEMs. We found that these modules also mediated efficient clearance of tau aggregates and HER2+ tumor cells via a non-classical phagocytosis mechanism through direct engagement of myeloid cells. This mode of clearance potentially avoids the known drawbacks of Fc\u03b3R-mediated antibody mechanisms in the brain such as the neurotoxic release of proinflammatory cytokines and immune cell exhaustion. Our study reports a new brain delivery platform that harnesses receptor-mediated transcytosis to maximize brain uptake and uses a non-classical phagocytosis mechanism to efficiently clear pathologic proteins and cells.

AMPK catalytic subunit \u03b11 (PRKAA1) is involved in various types of cancer and PRKAA1 knockdown significantly decreased the invasiveness of GC cells. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)-regulation of m6A has been shown to be involved in different diseases including cancer. However, the role of PRKAA1 and m6A modification in GC remains to be elucidated. PRKAA1 was silenced or overexpressed to study the role of PRKAA1 in regulating cell viability, colony formation, and glycolysis. Levels of lactic acid, GSH, and NADP+/NADPH were measured using commercial kits. Extracellular acidification rates were determined by an extracellular flux analyzer. RNA immunoprecipitation was performed to test m6A levels and the interaction between PRKAA1-3'-UTR and YTHDF2. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblots were applied to measure mRNA or protein levels, respectively. PRKAA1 silencing inhibited cell growth, colony formation, and glycolysis but enhanced apoptosis, while the PRKAA1 overexpression promoted cell growth, colony formation, and glycolysis but inhibited apoptosis of GC cells. Data also indicated that PRKAA1 regulated cell growth and apoptosis by regulating the redox balance. Mechanism study demonstrated that FTO regulated PRKAA1 mRNA m6A modification and stability. Clinical samples analysis demonstrated that PRKAA1 and FTO expression were increased in GC patients and positively correlated with each other. FTO increased levels of PRKAA1 by regulating its mRNA m6A modification and stability.

Studies highlight the importance of identifying early cardiac decline in cancer patients undergoing cardiotoxic therapies. Accurate tools to study this are a critical clinical need. Current and emerging methods for assessing cardiotoxicity are too coarse for identifying preclinical cardiac degradation or too cumbersome for clinical implementation. In the previous work, we developed a noninvasive biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging methodology (BEIM) to assess mechanical stiffness changes of the left ventricle (LV) based on routine cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. We examine this methodology to assess methodological reproducibility. We assessed a cohort of 10 participants that underwent test/retest short-axis CMR imaging at baseline and follow-up sessions as part of a previous publicly available study. We compare test images to retest images acquired within the same session to assess within-session reproducibility. We also compare test and retest images acquired at the baseline imaging session to test and retest images acquired at the follow-up imaging session to assess between-session reproducibility. We establish the within-session and between-session reproducibility of our method, with global elasticity demonstrating repeatability within a range previously demonstrated in cardiac strain imaging studies. We demonstrate increased repeatability of global elasticity compared to segmental elasticity for both within-session and between-session. Within-subject coefficients of variation for within-session test/retest images globally for all modulus directions and a mechanical fractional mechanical stiffness anisotropy metric ranged from 11% to 28%.

On biomimetic microfluidic devices, MSCs guided cancer cell migration in a \"cluster-sprout-infiltrating\" mode. Importantly, hypoxic conditions significantly promoted MSCs migration at the infiltration stage, leading to accelerated breast cancer cell invasion. Moreover, hypoxia related LncRNA analysis showed that H19 was dramatically upregulated in response to hypoxic conditions. Conversely, H19 depletion impaired MSCs-directed breast cancer cell invasion. Mechanistically, H19 functions as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) which sequesters miRNA let-7 to release its target matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1). Intriguingly, aspirin dramatically suppressed H19 and MMP1 expression and blocked MSCs infiltration under hypoxic conditions, resulting in alleviated breast cancer cell invasion.

Molecular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are now part of the established diagnostic tools for the clinical investigation of cognitive disorders in the elderly. Biomarkers allow for earlier and more accurate differential diagnosis, and are recommended by the Swiss Memory Clinics as an additional investigation based upon individual indication. Information and counselling are needed both before and after biomarker-supported diagnosis. The procedures for diagnostic lumbar punctures and pre-analytical sample handling should follow published recommendations. The results must be interpreted in the context of the other available history and assessment outcome. Thanks to recent research progress, blood-based biomarkers and other non-invasive markers are expected to become available for clinical practice in the near future. This trend will likely lead to a much broader utilisation of biomarkers and may accelerate the development of effective and individually tailored prevention and treatment approaches. This review article provides an overview over the current state of biomarkers and provides the recommendations of the Swiss Memory Clinics for their use in clinical practice. Zusammenfassung.

This study assessed data from 1,152 patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who were diagnosed with BC-PTML during 2000-2015. Patients were randomly divided into a training group (n=806) and a test group (n=346) at a ratio of 7:3 using the hold-out method. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were used to calculate the survival rate of patients. Subsequently, a stepwise Cox regression model was established to screen the prognostic factors of patients with BC-PTML, and these variables were used to construct a nomogram to predict 5-, 10-, and 15-year BC-PTML cancer-specific survival (CSS). The discrimination and calibration of the new model were evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curves, and the accuracy and benefits of the model were assessed through comparison with the traditional Ann Arbor staging system using decision curve analysis (DCA). After stepwise regression, the optimal model included radiotherapy, primary site surgery, Ann Arbor Stage, chemotherapy, histological subtype, and age at diagnosis. The C-index, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and DCA suggested that the nomogram had improved discriminatory ability and clinical benefit compared with the Ann Arbor staging system.

ZP3AR coats megabase regions of chromosome 7 encompassing genes encoding ZSCAN4, a master transcription factor of totipotency. Depleting ZFP819 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) causes them to transition to a 2-cell (2C)-like state, whereby the ZP3AR array switches from a poised to an active enhancer state. This is accompanied by a global erosion of heterochromatin roadblocks, which we link to decreased SETDB1 stability. These events result in transcription of active LINE-1 elements and impaired differentiation. In summary, ZFP819 and TRIM28 partner up to close chromatin across Zscan4, to promote exit from totipotency.

To this end, individuals without dementia (i.e., cognitively unimpaired or mild cognitive impairment, N\u2009=\u2009231) were selected from the BioFINDER-2 study. Amyloid-\u03b2-positive (A+) individuals were categorized into biomarker groups based on cut-offs for abnormal CSF P-tau217 and [18F]RO948 (Tau) PET, yielding groups of tau-concordant-negative (A\u2009+\u2009P-T-; n\u2009=\u200930), tau-discordant (i.e., A\u2009+\u2009P+T-; n\u2009=\u200948) and tau-concordant-positive (A\u2009+\u2009P+T+; n\u2009=\u200918) individuals.

While intercellular communication traditionally centers around chemokines, cytokines, inflammatory mediators, and growth factors, emerging pathways involving extracellular vesicles (EVs) are gaining increasing attention. The immunosuppressive TME is created and maintained in part by the large abundance of tumor-associated macrophages (TMAs), which are associated with drug resistance, poor prognosis, and have emerged as potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. TMAs are highly dynamic, and can be polarized into either M1 or M2-like macrophages. EVs are efficient cell-cell communication molecules that have been catapulted to the center of TMA polarization.

Most cases of AD are sporadic, and very few are inherited; the pathogenesis of sporadic AD is complex and remains to be elucidated. The asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain is the only recognized cysteine protease that specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds after asparagine residues in mammals. The expression level of AEPs in healthy brains is far lower than that of peripheral organs. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that aging may upregulate and overactivate brain AEPs. The overactivation of AEPs drives the onset of AD through cleaving tau and amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and SET, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The AEP-mediated cleavage of these peptides enhances amyloidosis, promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, and ultimately induces neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Upregulated AEPs and related deleterious reactions constitute upstream events of amyloid/tau toxicity in the brain, and represent early pathological changes in AD. Thus, upregulated AEPs are an emerging drug target for disease modification and a potential biomarker for predicting preclinical AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier greatly hinders establishing body-fluid-based methods to measure brain AEPs. Research on AEP-activity-based imaging probes and our recent work suggest that the live brain imaging of AEPs could be used to evaluate its predictive efficacy as an AD biomarker.

The AHH peptide keeps its beneficial ability against Cu(A\u03b2)-induced ROS, even in the presence of ZnII-competing ions and other biologically relevant ions. The detailed kinetic mechanism by which AHH could exert its action against Cu(A\u03b2)-induced ROS is also proposed.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36235754": {"ArticleTitle": "The Potential Neuroprotective Effects of Extracts from Oat Seedlings against Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "The physiological or dietary advantages of germinated grains have been the subject of numerous discussions over the past decade. Around 23 million tons of oats are consumed globally, making up a sizeable portion of the global grain market. Oat seedlings contain more protein, beta-glucan, free amino acids, and phenolic compounds than seeds. The progressive neurodegenerative disorder of Alzheimer's is accompanied by worsening memory and cognitive function. A key indicator of this disorder is the unusual buildup of amyloid-beta protein (or A\u03b2) in human brains. In this context, oat seedling extract (OSE) has been identified as a new therapeutic candidate for AD, due to its antioxidant activity and AD-specific mechanism of action. This study directly investigated how OSE affected AD and its impacts by examining the cognitive function and exploring the inflammatory response mechanism. The dried oat seedlings were grounded finely with a grinder, inserted with 50% fermented ethanol 10 times (w/v), and extracted by stirring for 10 h at 45 \u00b0C. After filtering the extract by 0.22 um filter, some of it was used for UHPLC analysis. The results indicated that the treatment with OSE protects against A\u03b225-35-induced cytotoxicity in BV2 cells. Tg-5Xfad AD mice had strong deposition of A\u03b2 throughout their brains, while WT mice did not exhibit any such deposition within their brains. A drastic reduction was observed in terms of numbers, as well as the size, of A\u03b2 plaques within Tg-5Xfad AD mice exposed to OSE. This study indicated OSE's neuroprotective impacts against neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation induced by amyloid-beta. Our results suggest that OSE acts as a neuroprotective agent to combat AD-specific apoptotic cell death, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta accumulation, as well as synaptic dysfunction in AD mice's brains. Furthermore, the study indicated that OSE treatment affects JNK/ERK/p38 MAPK signaling, with considerable inhibition in p-JNK, p-p38, and p-ERK levels seen in the brain of OSE-treated Tg-5Xfad AD mice.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36130840": {"ArticleTitle": "\u03b2-Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration Classification and Eligibility for Anti-amyloid Treatment in a Memory Clinic Population.", "AbstractText": "ATN (\u03b2-Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration) system categorizes individuals based on their core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. An important potential future use for ATN is therapeutic decision-making in clinical practice once disease-modifying treatments, e.g., anti-amyloid, become widely available. In this cross-sectional study, we applied ATN and estimated potential eligibility for anti-amyloid treatment in a real-life memory clinic with biomarker assessments integrated into the routine diagnostic procedure and all specialized resources available for the implementation of novel treatments. We included all consecutive patients at the Karolinska University Hospital Memory clinic in Solna, Stockholm, Sweden, who had their first diagnostic visit in April 2018-February 2021, informed consent for the clinic research database, and available clinical and biomarker (CSF, imaging) data. ATN classification was based on CSF A\u03b242 (or A\u03b242/40; A), CSF phosphorylated tau (T), and medial temporal lobe atrophy (N). For CSF markers, we applied laboratory cut-offs and data-driven cut-offs for comparison (determined with Gaussian mixture modelling). Anti-amyloid treatment eligibility was assessed following the published recommendations for aducanumab (AD dementia or MCI with no evidence of non-AD etiology, appropriate level of cognition, AD-consistent CSF profile). Study population consisted of 410 patients (52% subjective cognitive impairment, 23% mild cognitive impairment MCI, 25% any dementia; age 59\u00b17 years, 56% women). Regardless of biomarker cut-offs, most patients were A-T-N- (54-57%). A+ prevalence was 17-30% (higher with data-driven cut-offs). Up to 13% of all patients (27% of those with MCI and 28% of those with dementia) were potentially eligible for anti-amyloid treatment when AD-consistent CSF was defined as any A+ profile. When A+T+ profile was required, treatment was targeted more to the dementia than MCI stage (eligibility up to 14% in MCI, 22% in dementia). The opposite applied to earlier stage intervention (A+T-N-; eligibility up to 12% in MCI, 2% in dementia).

Community-based user-centered design principles were applied in the program development. First, the structure and curriculum of the WECARE program were crafted based on existing evidence-based interventions for caregivers with input from 4 experts. Second, through working closely with 8 stakeholders, we culturally adapted evidence-based programs into multimedia program components. Lastly, 5 target users tested the initial WECARE program; their experience and feedback were used to further refine the program. The resulting WECARE is a 7-week mHealth program delivered via WeChat, a social media app highly popular in Chinese Americans. By subscribing to the official WECARE account, users can receive 6 interactive multimedia articles pushed to their WeChat accounts each week for 7 weeks. The 7 major themes include (1) facts of dementia and caregiving; (2) the enhancement of caregiving skills; (3) effective communication with health care providers, care partners, and family members; (4) problem-solving skills for caregiving stress management; (5) stress reduction and depression prevention; (6) the practice of self-care and health behaviors; and (7) social support and available resources. Users also have the option of joining group chats for peer support. The WECARE program also includes a back-end database that manages intervention delivery and tracks user engagement. The WECARE program represents one of the first culturally tailored social media-based interventions for Chinese American caregivers of persons with dementia. It demonstrates the use of community-based user-centered design principles in developing an mHealth intervention program in underserved communities.

To date, there is little evidence on whether gait is altered in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We aimed to identify impairments in gait performance and associations between gait impairment and neuroimaging markers of CAA, cognition, and falls. Methods and Results Gait was assessed using the Zeno Walkway during preferred pace and dual task walks, and grouped into gait domains (Rhythm, Pace, Postural Control, and Variability). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Falls and fear of falling were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Gait domain scores were standardized and analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, height, and other covariates. Participants were patients with CAA (n=29), Alzheimer disease with mild dementia (n=16), mild cognitive impairment (n=24), and normal elderly controls (n=47). CAA and Alzheimer disease had similarly impaired Rhythm, Pace, and Variability, and higher dual task cost than normal controls or mild cognitive impairment. Higher Pace score was associated with better global cognition, processing speed, and memory. Gait measures were not correlated with microbleed count or white matter hyperintensity volume. Number of falls was not associated with gait domain scores, but participants with low fear of falling had higher Pace (odds ratio [OR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.59-4.29]) and lower Variability (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.44]).

The discrepancy between atrophy and cognitive decline was measured using the residuals from a linear regression analysis between change in whole brain cortical thickness over time and change in a cognitive composite measure over time in 395 cognitively unimpaired participants from the Swedish BioFINDER study. We tested for bivariate associations of this residual measure with demographic, imaging, and fluid biomarker variables using Pearson correlations and independent-samples t-tests, and for multivariate associations using linear regression models. Mediation analyses were performed to explore possible paths between the included variables. In bivariate analyses, older age (r = -0.11, p = 0.029), male sex (t = -3.00, p = 0.003), larger intracranial volume (r = -0.17, p < 0.001), carrying an APOEe4 allele (t = -2.71, p = 0.007), larger white matter lesion volume (r = -0.16, p = 0.002), lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) 42/40 ratio (t = -4.05, p < 0.001), and higher CSF levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 (r = -0.22, p < 0.001), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; r = -0.15, p = 0.003), and neurofilament light (NfL; r = -0.34, p < 0.001) were negatively associated with the residual measure, i.e., associated with worse than expected cognitive trajectory given the level of atrophy. In a multivariate analysis, only lower CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio and higher CSF NfL levels explained cognition beyond brain atrophy.

Focused ultrasound applied together with microbubbles (FUS+MB) is a novel technique to transiently open the BBB and increase drug delivery. Evidence suggests that FUS+MB is safe, however, the effects of FUS+MB on human BBB cells, especially in the context of AD, remain sparsely investigated. In addition, there currently are no cell platforms to test for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery. Methods: Here we generated BBB cells (induced brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs) and astrocytes (iAstrocytes)) from apolipoprotein E gene allele E4 (APOE4, high sporadic AD risk) and allele E3 (APOE3, lower AD risk) carrying patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We established mono- and co-culture models of human sporadic AD and control BBB cells to investigate the effects of FUS+MB on BBB cell phenotype and to screen for the delivery of two potentially therapeutic AD antibodies, an Aducanumab-analogue (AduhelmTM; anti-amyloid-\u03b2) and a novel anti-Tau antibody, RNF5. We then developed a novel hydrogel-based 2.5D BBB model as a step towards a more physiologically relevant FUS+MB drug delivery platform. Results: When compared to untreated cells, the delivery of Aducanumab-analogue and RNF5 was significantly increased (up to 1.73 fold), across the Transwell-based BBB models following FUS+MB treatment. Our results also demonstrated the safety of FUS+MB indicated by minimal changes in iBEC transcriptome as well as little or no changes in iBEC or iAstrocyte viability and inflammatory responses within the first 24 h post FUS+MB. Furthermore, we demonstrated successful iBEC barrier formation in our novel 2.5D hydrogel-based BBB model with significantly increased delivery (1.4 fold) of Aducanumab-analogue following FUS+MB. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a robust and reproducible approach to utilize patient cells for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery screening in vitro.

Every 6 weeks, the participants completed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). The participants independently accessed Constant Therapy using an Apple iPad. Our primary feasibility outcomes were the rate of adherence and daily use of Constant Therapy over 24 weeks. Our secondary outcomes were Constant Therapy performance over 24 weeks and change in RBANS scores between the 2 experimental groups. Feasibility analyses were computed for participants who completed 24 weeks of Constant Therapy. We found that long-term use of the Constant Therapy program was feasible in patients with AD over 24 weeks (adherence 80%; program use 121/168 days, for 32 minutes daily). These participants showed an overall improvement in accuracy and latency (P=.005) in the Constant Therapy scores, as well as specific improvements in visual and auditory memory, attention, and arithmetic tasks.

The execution of effective treatment approaches through further trials investigating a rational combination of agents is necessitude for Alzheimer's disease. For this review, more than 248 relevant scientific papers were considered from a variety of databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Sciencedirect, and Pubmed) using the keywords Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-\u03b2, combination therapies, cholinesterase inhibitors, dementia, glutamate regulators, AD hypothesis. The researcher&#039;s intent for either developing a disease-modifying therapeutic means for aiming in the early phases of dementia and/or optimizing the available symptomatic treatments principally committed to the more advanced stages of Alzheimer's. Since Alzheimer possesses multifactorial pathogenesis, designing a multimodal therapeutic intervention for targeting different pathological processes of dementia may appear to be the most practical method to alter the course of disease progression. The combination approach may even allow for providing individual agents in lower doses, with reducible cost and side effects. Numerous studies on combination therapy predicted better clinical efficacy than monotherapy.

Furthermore, we also explored the relationship between LPCAT1 expression and drug sensitivity to HCC treatment. The expression profiles were acquired from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Human Protein Atlas (THPA). Immune status and infiltration in cancer tissues were explored using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and CIBERSORT algorithm. LPCAT1 was overexpressed in HCC, and its expression was related to poor prognosis, LPCAT1 was an independent prognostic biomarker in HCC. Expression of LPCAT1 increased statistically with the increase of clinical stage and grade of HCC patients. GO and KEGG network analysis revealed that LPCAT1 positively associated molecules were mostly enriched in functions related to cell adhesion. The TME score of high-LPCAT1 group was significantly higher than that of low-LPCAT1 group. Immune infiltrating cells positively correlated with LPCAT1 expression were Macrophages M0, B cells memory, Dendritic cells activated, T cells regulatory and T cells gamma delta in HCC. We found a positive correlation between LPCAT1 and most immune checkpoint gene expression. The IC50 of 5-Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine, Mitomycin C, Sorafenib and Cabozantinib in patients with high-LPCAT1 expression was lower than that in patients with low-LPCAT1 expression.

This study elucidates the mechanistic action of D-limonene channelized by the induction of apoptosis for controlling proliferation in breast cancer cells. The possible mechanism was explored through an experimental and computational approach to estimate cell proliferation inhibition, cell cycle phase distribution, apoptosis analysis using a flow cytometry, western blotting and molecular docking.

Nevertheless, the relative roles, or identity, of the proteinase -dependent or -independent mechanisms used by macrophages versus cancer cells to transmigrate basement membrane barriers harboring physiologically-relevant covalent crosslinks remains ill-defined. Herein, both macrophages and cancer cells are shown to mobilize membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinases to proteolytically remodel native basement membranes isolated from murine tissues while infiltrating the underlying interstitial matrix ex vivo. In the absence of proteolytic activity, however, only macrophages deploy actomyosin-generated forces to transmigrate basement membrane pores, thereby providing the cells with proteinase-independent access to the interstitial matrix while simultaneously exerting global effects on the macrophage transcriptome. By contrast, cancer cell invasive activity is reliant on metalloproteinase activity and neither mechanical force nor changes in nuclear rigidity rescue basement membrane transmigration.

Cholesterol, an important component of membranes, is well-recognized as a risk factor in AD. It can affect the aggregation and pore formation of A\u03b2 on membranes whereas the specific effects are rather complex, particularly regarding the non-linear response to cholesterol concentrations. Yet, the mechanistic understanding of the role of cholesterol in A\u03b2-membrane interactions remains incomplete. Herein, we employed microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of cholesterol on A\u03b2 dimerization in a lipid bilayer containing different molar ratios of cholesterol (0, 20, and 40 mol %). Cholesterol reduces the time required for the formation of stable dimers and exerts dual effects on A\u03b2-membrane interactions. First, cholesterol promotes the extraction of the C-terminal region from the membrane to water. Consequently, at the ratios of 0 and 20 mol %, peptides are anchored at the membrane-water interface, but they are repelled to water at a ratio of 40 mol % with high structural flexibility. Second, cholesterol weakens A\u03b2-membrane interactions, thereby enhancing inter-peptide interactions. The former is favorable for dimerization while the latter is not. The balance between two factors eventually leads to a non-monotonic effect on the degree of dimerization, whereby the number of inter-peptide contacts is the largest at a cholesterol ratio of 20 mol %.

In addition, the classifiers show high overall performance with 94.12% accuracy and 0.87 MCC. Regarding the discrimination power between healthy and AD patients, the classification algorithms showed high effectiveness with the mean scores separated by three or more standard deviations. The PARAFAC's spectral profiles and the wavelength values from both models loading profiles can be used in future research to relate this information to plasma AD biomarkers.

Lasso Cox regression was used to construct a genomic mutation signature (GMS), and the prognostic value of GMS could be able to verify in the Rizvi cohort (N = 240) and Hellmann cohort (N = 75). We further conducted immunotherapy-related characteristics analysis in TCGA cohort (N = 1052). A total of seven genes (ZFHX3, NTRK3, EPHA7, MGA, STK11, EPHA5, TP53) were identified for GMS model construction. Compared with GMS-high patients, patients with GMS-low had longer overall survival (P < 0.001) in the MSKCC cohort and progression-free survival (P < 0.001) in the validation cohort. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that GMS was an independent predictive factor for NSCLC patients in both the MSKCC and validation cohort. Meanwhile, we found that GMS-low patients reflected enhanced anti-tumor immunity in TCGA cohort.

A\u03b2 accumulation activates microglia, which secrete proinflammatory factors associated with A\u03b2 clearance impairment and cause neurotoxicity, generating a vicious cycle among A\u03b2 accumulation, activated microglia, and proinflammatory factors. Blocking this cycle can be a therapeutic strategy for AD. Using A\u03b2-activated HMC3 microglial cells, we observed that isorhamnetin, a main constituent of Oenanthe javanica, reduced the A\u03b2-triggered secretion of interleukin- (IL-) 6 and downregulated the expression levels of the microglial activation markers ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) and CD11b and the inflammatory marker nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB).

Keratinocytes expressing one (H) or two (HH) mutant alleles of HrasG12D, one KrasG12D allele (K), or one of each (HK) were studied. All combinations of activated Ras alleles stimulated proliferation and drove transformation marker expression, but only HH and HK formed tumors. HH, HK, and K sustained long-term keratinocyte growth in vitro, while H and WT could not. RNA-Seq yielded two distinct gene expression profiles; HH, HK and K formed one cluster while H clustered with WT. Weak MAPK activation was seen in H keratinocytes but treatment with a BRAF inhibitor enhanced MAPK signaling and facilitated tumor formation. K keratinocytes became tumorigenic when they were isolated from mice where the LSL-KrasG12D allele was backcrossed from the C57BL/6 onto the FVB/N background.

AD and POAG have common symptoms, and therefore several common principles for their early diagnosis can be developed. Therefore, a promising direction is the search for biomarkers for the early detection of AD and POAG. Currently, the diagnosis of early AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and biomarkers in the brain (imaging of amyloid plaques and tau positron emission tomography) are well studied, while data in literature on using these biomarkers in patients with POAG is scarce. However, the above diagnostic methods are not considered in routine clinical practice due to their invasiveness and high cost. There is a growing need for conventional, affordable biomarkers for AD and POAG, as it is necessary to start treatment of prodromal conditions from symptoms to onset of symptoms. In this connection, biomarkers such as A\u03b2 and tau protein in blood serum and plasma are actively evaluated in patients with AD.

Blood cells of subjects that are exposed to lead detected in the circulatory system, potentially reflect molecular responses to this exposure that are similar to the response of neurons. In this study we analyzed blood cell-derived miRNAs derived from a general population as proxies of potentially AD-related mechanisms triggered by lead exposure.

Moreover, two miRNAs (miR-3651, miR-664b-3p) showed significant differential expression in AD brains versus controls, in accordance with the change direction of lead exposure. The miRNAs' gene targets were validated for expression in the human brain and were found enriched in AD-relevant pathways such as axon guidance.

The performance of the downstream task generally improves when these latent representations are explicitly associated with factors of interest. For example, we derived such a representation for capturing brain aging by applying self-supervised learning to longitudinal MRIs and then used the resulting encoding to automatically identify diseases accelerating the aging of the brain. We now propose a refinement of this representation by replacing the linear modeling of brain aging with one that is consistent in local neighborhoods in the latent space. Called Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE), we derive an encoding so that neighborhoods are age-consistent (i.e., brain MRIs of different subjects with similar brain ages are in close proximity of each other) and progression-consistent, i.e., the latent space is defined by a smooth trajectory field where each trajectory captures changes in brain ages between a pair of MRIs extracted from a longitudinal sequence. To make the problem computationally tractable, we further propose a strategy for mini-batch sampling so that the resulting local neighborhoods accurately approximate the ones that would be defined based on the whole cohort. We evaluate LNE on three different downstream tasks: (1) to predict chronological age from T1-w MRI of 274 healthy subjects participating in a study at SRI International; (2) to distinguish Normal Control (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (sMCI) from progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (pMCI) based on T1-w MRI of 632 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); and (3) to distinguish no-to-low from moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinkers based on fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor MRIs of 764 adolescents recruited by the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Across the three data sets, the visualization of the smooth trajectory vector fields and superior accuracy on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information related to brain aging, which could help study the impact of substance use and neurodegenerative disorders.

MRI images from 396 GBM and 190 LGG (115 astrocytoma and 75 oligodendroglioma) patients were standardized to construct frequency maps and analyzed by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. We then investigated the spatial correlation between glioma distribution with gene expression in healthy brains. We also evaluated transcriptomic differences in tumor tissue from predilection and nonpredilection sites. Furthermore, we quantitively characterized tumor anatomical localization and explored whether it was significantly related to overall survival. Finally, we employed a support vector machine to build a survival prediction model for GBM patients. GBMs exhibited a distinct location predilection from LGGs. GBMs were nearer to the subventricular zone and more likely to be localized to regions enriched with synaptic signaling, whereas astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma tended to occur in areas associated with the immune response. Synapse, neurotransmitters, and calcium ion channel-related genes were all activated in GBM tissues coming from predilection regions. Furthermore, we characterized tumor location features in terms of a series of tumor-to-predilection distance metrics, which were able to predict GBM one-year survival status with an accuracy of 0.71.

The predominant genetic risk factor for LOAD is the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele (APOE4), and the prevalence of LOAD is higher in females. However, the translational validity of APOE4 mouse models for AD-related cognitive impairment remains to be fully determined. The present study investigated the role of both sex and genotype on learning and memory in aged, humanized APOE knock-in mice. Aged (23.27 mo \u00b1 1.21 mo; 39 male/37 female) APOE3/3, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4 mice performed a novel object recognition (NOR) assay. Task-related metrics were analyzed using two-way sex by genotype ANOVAs. Sex differences were more prominent relative to APOE genotype. Prior to NOR, female mice exhibited thigmotaxic center zone avoidance during the open field task relative to males, regardless of genotype. Within object familiarization and NOR tasks, females had greater object interaction and locomotion. Interestingly, only APOE4/4 females on average recognized the novel object. These results suggest that APOE4, although strongly related to LOAD pathogenesis, does not drive cognitive decline in the absence of other risk factors even in very aged mice. Chromosomal sex is a key driver of behavioral phenotypes and thus is a critical variable for translatability of interventions designed to preserve learning and memory in animal models of LOAD. Last, there was a very high degree of variability in behavioral performance across APOE genotypes. A cluster analysis of the behavioral data revealed a low-activity and a high-activity cluster. APOE4 carriers were overrepresented in the low-activity cluster, while male:female distributions did not differ. Collectively, the behavioral data indicate that chromosomal sex has the greatest impact on behavioral phenotype, and APOE4 carrier status may confer greater risk for cognitive decline in some animals.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36207441": {"ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer's disease: insights from a network medicine perspective.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that currently lacks available effective therapy.

A significant amount of A\u03b2 would be expected to be present in the cytoplasm of cells with herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) applied, as APP endocytosis would be induced by HSV-1, which leads to higher A\u03b2 levels inside the cell. In this paper, a new hypothesis is presented on how HSV-1 infection initiates APP endocytosis and causes an increase in APP cleavage and A\u03b2 production inside the cells. It is also hypothesized that increased A\u03b2 peptides exit the cell via exocytosis, therefore, leading to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The findings will support the hypothesis if intracellular A\u03b2 concentration is significantly higher after the introduction of dHSV-1 and subsequently if extracellular A\u03b2 concentration becomes higher without TeNT exocytosis inhibition.

The Calprotectin subunits S100A8 and S100A9 mark myeloid-derived suppressor cells in other HPV-related entities while their receptor CD147 was discussed to identify patients with PeCa at a higher risk for poor prognoses and treatment failure. We thus examined their expression using immunohistochemistry staining of PeCa specimens from 74 patients on tissue microarrays of the tumor center, the invasion front, and lymph node metastases. Notably, whereas the tumor center was significantly more intensively stained than the invasion front, lymph node metastases were thoroughly positive for both S100 subunits. An HPV-positive status combined with an S100A8+S100A9+ profile was related with an elevated risk for metastases. We observed several PeCa specimens with S100A8+S100A9+-infiltrating immune cells overlapping with CD15 marking neutrophils. The S100A8+S100A9+CD15+ profile was associated with dedifferentiated and metastasizing PeCa, predominantly of HPV-associated subtype.

The nodes are classified into two classes: critical nodes and ordinary nodes, based on the change of the number of driver nodes upon its removal. Eight topological properties (out-degree DO, in-degree DI, degree D, betweenness B, closeness CA, in-closeness CI, out-closeness CO and clustering coefficient CC) are calculated in this paper and the results prove that the critical genes have higher score of topological properties than the ordinary genes. Then two bioinformatic analysis are used to explore the biologic significance of the critical genes. On the one hand, the enrichment scores in several kinds of gene databases are calculated and reveal that the critical nodes are richer in essential genes, cancer genes and the neuron related disease genes than the ordinary nodes, which indicates that the critical nodes may be the biomarker in brain-specific gene regulatory network. On the other hand, GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis are applied on them and the results show that the critical genes mainly take part in 14 KEGG pathways that are transcriptional misregulation in cancer, pathways in cancer and so on, which indicates that the critical genes are related to the brain tumor. Finally, by deleting the edges or routines in the network, the robustness analysis of node classification is realized, and the robustness of node classification is proved.

Therefore, we examined other molecules that could help explain the acquired cancer properties during E7-induced cancer development. Using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method, we found that the Elk-1 factor, which is crucial for cell proliferation, invasion, cell survival, anti-apoptotic activity, and cancer development, binds to the E7. By determining which part of E7 binds to which domain of Elk-1 using the Y2H method, it was found that CR2 and CR3 of the E7 and parts 1-206, including the ETS-DNA domain of Elk-1, interact with each other. As a result of their interaction, the transcriptional activity of Elk-1 was increased, thereby increasing the expression of target genes EGR-1, c-fos, and E2F. Additionally, the colony forming assay revealed that overexpression of Elk-1 and E7 promotes C33A cell proliferation.

This study explored the interaction mechanisms between AhR and BCL-2 in CSC development and chemoresistance. A quantitative proteomic analysis study was performed as a tool for comparative expression analysis of breast cancer cells treated by AhR agonist. The basal and inducible levels of Bcl-2, AhR, and CYP1A1 in vitro breast cancer cell lines and in vivo mice animal models were determined by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, silencing of the target, and immunohistochemistry.

Activation of the AhR/CYP1A1 pathway in mice increases EpCAMHigh/CD49fLowCD61Pos luminal progenitor-like cells in early tumor formation but not in advanced tumors. In parallel, a chemoproteomic study on breast cancer MCF-7 cells revealed that the BCL-2 protein was the most upregulated upon AhR activation.

In our previous work, we constrained valvular interstitial cell (VIC) monolayers on circular protein islands to study emergent behavior in a controlled manner and demonstrated that the general patterns of cell alignment, size, and apoptosis correlate with predicted mechanical stress fields if radially increasing stiffness or contractility are used in the computational models. However, these radially symmetric models did not predict the existence of local regions of dense aligned cells observed in seemingly random locations of individual aggregates. The goal of this study is to determine how the heterogeneities in cell behavior emerge over time and diverge from the predicted collective cell behavior. Cell-cell interactions in circular multicellular aggregates of VICs were studied with time-lapse imaging ranging from hours to days, and migration, proliferation, and traction stresses were measured. Our results indicate that elongated cells create strong local alignment within preconfluent cell populations on the microcontact printed protein islands. These cells influence the alignment of additional cells to create dense, locally aligned bands of cells which disrupt the predicted global behavior. Cells are highly elongated at the endpoints of the bands yet have decreased spread area in the middle and reduced mobility. Although traction stresses at the endpoints of bands are enhanced, even to the point of detaching aggregates from the culture surface, the cells in dense bands exhibit reduced proliferation, less nuclear YAP, and increased apoptotic rates indicating a low stress environment. These findings suggest that strong local cell-cell interactions between primary fibroblastic cells can disrupt the global collective cellular behavior leading to substantial heterogeneity of cell behaviors in constrained monolayers. This local emergent behavior within aggregated fibroblasts may play an important role in development and disease of connective tissues. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Mechanical stress patterns emerging from collective cell behavior play critical roles in morphogenesis, tissue repair, and cancer metastasis. Much has been learned of these collective behaviors by utilizing microcontact printing to constrain cell monolayers (aggregates) into specific shapes. Here we utilize these tools along with long-term video microscopy tracking of individual aggregates to determine how heterogeneous collective behaviors unique to primary fibroblastic cells emerge over time and diverge from computed stress fields. We find that dense multicellular bands form from local collective behavior and disrupt the global collective behavior resulting in heterogeneous patterns of migration, traction stresses, proliferation, and apoptosis.

To explore this, we assessed bulk and single-nuclear RNA sequencing data sets generated from four human derived myeloid cell populations: post-mortem microglial nuclei, peripheral monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and induced pluripotent stem cell derived microglial-like cells (MGLs). We found that expression of AD risk genes, gene signatures associated with the inflammatory response in AD, and genes related to proinflammatory immune responses were enriched in microglial nuclei isolated from aged female donors without ante-mortem neurological disease, relative to those from males. In addition, these inflammation-associated gene sets were found to be enriched in peripheral monocytes isolated from postmenopausal women and in MDMs obtained from premenopausal individuals relative to age-matched males. Expression of these gene sets did not differ in MDMs derived from women whose blood was sampled across the menstrual cycle or in MGLs cultured with 17\u03b2-oestradiol.

FAD mutations such as \"Iowa\" (D23N), \"Arctic\" (E22G), \"Italian\" (E22K), and \"Dutch\" (E22Q) have been shown to accelerate A\u03b2 aggregation relative to the wild-type (WT). The mechanism by which these mutations facilitate increased aggregation is unknown, but each mutation results in a change in the net charge of the peptide. Previous studies have used nonpolarizable force fields to study A\u03b2, providing some insight into how this protein unfolds. However, nonpolarizable force fields have fixed charges that lack the ability to redistribute in response to changes in local electric fields. Here, we performed polarizable molecular dynamics simulations on the full-length A\u03b242 of WT and FAD mutations and calculated folding free energies of the A\u03b215-27 fragment via umbrella sampling. By studying both the full-length A\u03b242 and a fragment containing mutations and the central hydrophobic cluster (residues 17-21), we were able to systematically study how these FAD mutations impact secondary and tertiary structure and the thermodynamics of folding. Electrostatic interactions, including those between permanent and induced dipoles, affected side-chain properties, salt bridges, and solvent interactions. The FAD mutations resulted in shifts in the electronic structure and solvent accessibility at the central hydrophobic cluster and the hydrophobic C-terminal region. Using umbrella sampling, we found that the folding of the WT and E22 mutants is enthalpically driven, whereas the D23N mutant is entropically driven, arising from a different unfolding pathway and peptide-bond dipole response. Together, the unbiased, full-length, and umbrella sampling simulations of fragments reveal that the FAD mutations perturb nearby residues and others in hydrophobic regions to potentially alter solubility.

Several phytocannabinoids, terpenes and select flavonoids demonstrated neuroprotection through a myriad of cellular and molecular pathways, including cannabinoid receptor-mediated, antioxidant and direct anti-aggregatory actions against the pathological toxic hallmark protein in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid \u03b2. These findings provide strong evidence for a role of cannabis constituents, individually or in combination, as potential neuroprotectants timely to the emergent use of medicinal cannabis as a novel treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.

Serine/arginine-rich protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), a key splicing regulator, is reported to be\u00a0overexpressed in leukemia and other cancer types, which suggests the therapeutic potential of targeting SRPK1. SRPK1 expression was measured in 41 ENKTL patients by immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT\u2012PCR. We knocked down SRPK1 expression in\u00a0the ENKTL cell line YT by siRNA transfection\u00a0and inhibited SRPK1 using inhibitors (SPHINX31 and SRPIN340) in YT cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) isolated from ENKTL patients\u00a0to investigate its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Then, RNA-seq analysis was performed to predict the potential signaling pathway by which SRPK1 inhibition induces cell death and further verified this prediction by Western blotting. In the present study, we initially evaluated the clinical significance of SRPK1 in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), a very aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The expression of SRPK1 in ENKLT patients was examined by immunohistochemistry and qRT\u2012PCR, which revealed SRPK1 overexpression in more than 60% of ENKTL specimens and its association with worse survival. Cellular experiments using the human ENKTL cell line YT and PBLs from ENKTL patients, demonstrated that inhibition of SRPK1 suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Subsequently, we investigated the downstream targets of SRPK1 by RNA-seq analysis and found that SRPK1 inhibition induced ATF4/CHOP pathway activation and AKT1 inhibition. Furthermore, ENKTL patients presenting high SRPK1 expression showed resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The association of SRPK1 expression with cisplatin resistance was also confirmed in YT cells. SRPK1 overexpression via pLVX-SRPK1 plasmid transfection\u00a0dramatically decreased the sensitivity of YT cells to cisplatin, while siRNA-mediated\u00a0SRPK1 knockdown or SRPK1 inhibitor treatment significantly increased cisplatin cytotoxicity.

Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are related to pathogen glycans, to which nascent or natural antibodies exist and IgM responses are elicited. To capture the polyspecific nature of anticarbohydrate responses, we have focused on the rational design of carbohydrate mimetic peptides (CMPs) cross-reactive with TACA reactive antibodies. In particular, we have focused on the development of CMPs that display reactivity to GD2 and Lewis Y (LeY) reactive monoclonal antibodies. They would serve as templates for pan-immunogens inducing biosimilar polyreactive antibodies. In the design, we relied on structural analyses of CMP's enhanced binding to the templates using molecular modeling. Glycan reactivity patterns of affinity CMP-purified human antibodies further refined specificity profiles in comparison with the immune response to the CMP in clinical trials.

Rafts are believed to impact the development of different neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's ones, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, some types of cancer, etc. These diseases correlate with the change in the membrane lipid composition resulting from an oxidative stress, age-related processes, dysfunction of proteins, and many others. In particular, a lot of studies report a significant rise in the level of lysolipids. Physicochemical properties of rafts are determined by membrane composition, in particular, by the content of lysolipids. Lysolipids may thus regulate raft-involving processes. However, the exact mechanism of such regulation is unknown. Although studying rafts in vivo still seems to be rather complicated, liquid-ordered domains are well observed in model systems. In the present study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine how lysophospholipids influence the liquid-ordered domains in model ternary membranes. We demonstrated that even a small amount of lysolipids in a membrane significantly impacts domain size depending on the saturation of the lysolipid hydrocarbon tails and the amount of cholesterol.

This review will cover all stem cells like mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and neural stem cells. Clinical trials of AD have also been discussed. Finally, limitations of stem cells are discussed with ongoing clinical trials, and in the future stem cell therapy can be used for treatment of AD.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36189597": {"ArticleTitle": "Photobiomodulation for Hypertension and Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "Although the cause(s) of Alzheimer's disease in the majority of cases remains elusive, it has long been associated with hypertension. In animal models of the disease, hypertension has been shown to exacerbate Alzheimer-like pathology and behavior, while in humans, hypertension during mid-life increases the risk of developing the disease later in life. Unfortunately, once individuals are diagnosed with the disease, there are few therapeutic options available. There is neither an effective symptomatic treatment, one that treats the debilitating cognitive and memory deficits, nor, more importantly, a neuroprotective treatment, one that stops the relentless progression of the pathology. Further, there is no specific preventative treatment that offsets the onset of the disease. A key factor or clue in this quest for an effective preventative and therapeutic treatment may lie in the contribution of hypertension to the disease. In this review, we explore the idea that photobiomodulation, the application of specific wavelengths of light onto body tissues, can reduce the neuropathology and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease by controlling hypertension. We suggest that treatment with photobiomodulation can be an effective preventative and therapeutic option for this neurodegenerative disease.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36269420": {"ArticleTitle": "Characterization of microtubule-associated protein tau isoforms and Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in normal sheep (Ovis aries): relevance to their potential as a model of Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that accounts for up to 80% of all dementias. Characterised by deteriorations of memory and cognitive function, the key neuropathological features are accumulations of \u03b2-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, as 'plaques' and 'tangles', respectively. Despite extensive study, however, the exact mechanism underlying aggregate formation in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive, as does the contribution of these aggregates to disease progression. Importantly, a recent evaluation of current Alzheimer's disease animal models suggested that rodent models are not able to fully recapitulate the pathological intricacies of the disease as it occurs in humans. Therefore, increasing attention is being paid to species that might make good alternatives to rodents for studying the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The sheep (Ovis aries) is one such species, although to date, there have been few molecular studies relating to Alzheimer's disease in sheep. Here, we investigated the Alzheimer's disease relevant histopathological characteristics of 22 sheep, using anti-\u03b2-amyloid (Abcam 12267 and mOC64) and phosphorylation specific anti-tau (AT8 and S396) antibodies. We identified numerous intraneuronal aggregates of both \u03b2-amyloid and tau that are consistent with early Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. We confirmed the expression of two 3-repeat (1N3R, 2N3R) and two 4-repeat (1N4R, 2N4R) tau isoforms in the ovine brain, which result from the alternative splicing of two tau exons. Finally, we investigated the phosphorylation status of the serine396 residue in 30 sheep, and report that the phosphorylation of this residue begins in sheep aged as young as 2\u00a0years. Together, these data show that sheep exhibit naturally occurring \u03b2-amyloid and tau pathologies, that reflect those that occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This is an important step towards the validation of the sheep as a feasible large animal species in which to model Alzheimer's disease.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36107840": {"ArticleTitle": "Hospital-treated infections in early- and mid-life and risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A nationwide nested case-control study in Sweden.", "AbstractText": "Experimental observations have suggested a role of infection in the etiology of neurodegenerative disease. In human studies, however, it is difficult to disentangle whether infection is a risk factor or rather a comorbidity or secondary event of neurodegenerative disease. To this end, we examined the risk of 3 most common neurodegenerative diseases in relation to previous inpatient or outpatient episodes of hospital-treated infections. We performed a nested case-control study based on several national registers in Sweden. Cases were individuals newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) during 1970 to 2016 in Sweden, identified from the National Patient Register. For each case, 5 controls individually matched to the case on sex and year of birth were randomly selected from the general population. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with adjustment for potential confounders, including sex, year of birth, area of residence, educational attainment, family history of neurodegenerative disease, and Charlson comorbidity index. Infections experienced within 5 years before diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease were excluded to reduce the influence of surveillance bias and reverse causation. The analysis included 291,941 AD cases (median age at diagnosis: 76.2 years; male: 46.6%), 103,919 PD cases (74.3; 55.1%), and 10,161 ALS cases (69.3; 56.8%). A hospital-treated infection 5 or more years earlier was associated with an increased risk of AD (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.18, P < 0.001) and PD (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.06, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for bacterial, viral, and other infections and among different sites of infection including gastrointestinal and genitourinary infections. Multiple infections before age 40 conveyed the greatest risk of AD (OR = 2.62, 95% CI: 2.52 to 2.72, P < 0.001) and PD (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.53, P < 0.001). The associations were primarily due to AD and PD diagnosed before 60 years (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.89 to 1.98 for AD, P < 0.001; OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.36 for PD, P < 0.001), whereas no association was found for those diagnosed at 60 years or older (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.01 for AD, P = 0.508; OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.03 for PD, P = 0.382). No association was observed for ALS (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.03, P = 0.384), regardless of age at diagnosis. Excluding infections experienced within 10 years before diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease confirmed these findings. Study limitations include the potential misclassification of hospital-treated infections and neurodegenerative diseases due to incomplete coverage of the National Patient Register, as well as the residual confounding from unmeasured risk or protective factors for neurodegenerative diseases. Hospital-treated infections, especially in early- and mid-life, were associated with an increased risk of AD and PD, primarily among AD and PD cases diagnosed before 60 years. These findings suggest that infectious events may be a trigger or amplifier of a preexisting disease process, leading to clinical onset of neurodegenerative disease at a relatively early age.

In AD, a subpopulation of astrocytes acquires a neurotoxic phenotype which prompts them to lose typical physiological features. While the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, evidence suggests that myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein may play a role in coordinating these cells' immune responses in AD. Herein, we combined studies in human postmortem samples with a conditional genetic knockout mouse model to investigate the link between MyD88 and astrocytes in AD. In silico analyses of bulk and cell-specific transcriptomic data from human postmortem brains demonstrated an upregulation of MyD88 expression in astrocytes in AD versus non-AD individuals. Proteomic studies revealed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein in multiple brain regions of AD subjects. These studies also showed that although overall MyD88 steady-state levels were unaffected by AD, this protein was enriched in astrocytes near amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Functional studies in mice indicated that the deletion of astrocytic MyD88 protected animals from the acute synaptic toxicity and cognitive impairment caused by the intracerebroventricular administration of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Lastly, unbiased proteomic analysis revealed that loss of astrocytic MyD88 resulted in altered astrocyte reactivity, lower levels of immune-related proteins, and higher expression of synaptic-related proteins in response to A\u03b2.

Detailed knowledge on their mechanism of implication in the AD pathogenesis can help to develop novel therapeutic and disease management strategies.

Based on their 5-year cognitive progression, we stratified 117 cognitively normal participants (78.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0 years of age, 52 women) into three age-matched groups, each with a different level of risk for Alzheimer's disease. From their fluorodeoxyglucose PET we constructed metabolic networks, evaluated their modular structures using the Louvain algorithm, and compared them between risk groups. As the risk for Alzheimer's disease increased, the metabolic connections among brain regions weakened and became more modular, indicating network fragmentation and functional impairment of the brain. We then set out to determine the correlation between regional brain metabolism, particularly in the modules derived from the previous analysis, and the regional expression of Alzheimer-risk genes in the brain, obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. In all risk groups of this elderly population, the regional brain expression of most Alzheimer-risk genes showed a strong correlation with brain metabolism, particularly in the module that corresponded to regions of the brain that are affected earliest and most severely in Alzheimer's disease.

In this way, clustering can serve as a cellular switch. The underlying uneven distribution and local enrichment of the signaling cluster's constituting membrane proteins can be used as a functional readout.

Models of care and associated timeframes are described, including a pre-FP program model, establishment of a formal FP program, integration of nurse navigators, and the addition of FP consult stratification based on urgency (urgent/nonurgent). The number of patient consults within each model, patient sex, diagnosis (oncologic/hematologic), and consult timing (pre-gonadotoxic treatment/posttreatment completion) were abstracted from the clinical database. The number of annual consults increased from 24 during the pre-FP program model (2015) to 181 during the current care model (2020). Over time, the proportion of consults for females and patients with nonmalignant hematologic disorders increased. Patient stratification reduced the proportion of consults needing to be completed urgently from 75% at the advent of the FP program to 49% in the current model.

The human TREM2R47H variant associated with high AD risk fails to activate microglia via SYK.

This approval has raised an unprecedented controversy. It was followed by a refusal of the European Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials. Compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, the common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid immunotherapies is their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients. Here, we review the available evidence regarding efficacy and safety data and medico-economical aspects for high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies. We also perform frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy and safety of the highest dose groups from the two aducanumab phase 3 trials and the donanemab and lecanemab phase 2 trials. When pooled together, the data from high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies trials confirm a statistically significant clinical effect of these drugs on cognitive decline after 18 months (difference in cognitive decline measured with CDR-SB after 18 months between the high dose immunotherapy groups vs. placebo\u00a0=\u00a0-0.24 points; P=0.04, frequentist random-effect model), with results on ADAS-Cog being the most statistically robust.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow stresses provide the energy needed to induce molecular conformation changes leading to AD by initiating amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau aggregation. Shear and extensional flow stresses initiate aggregation in the laboratory and in natural biophysical processes. Energy-rich CSF flow regions are mainly found in lower brain regions. MRI studies reveal flow stress \"hot spots\" in basal cisterns and brain ventricles that have chaotic flow properties that can distort molecules such as A\u03b2 and tau trapped in these regions into unusual conformations. Such fluid disturbance is surrounded by tissue deformation. There is strong mapping overlap between the locations of these hot spots and of early-stage AD pathology. Our mechanism creates pure and mixed protein dimers, followed by tissue surface adsorption, and long-term tissue agitation ultimately inducing chemical reactions forming more stable, toxic oligomer seeds that initiate AD. It is proposed that different flow stress energies and flow types in different basal brain regions produce different neurotoxic aggregates. Proliferating artery hardening is responsible for enhanced heart systolic pulses that drive energetic CSF pulses, whose critical maximum systolic pulse energy location migrates further from the heart with increasing vascular disease. Two glymphatic systems, carotid and basilar, are suggested to contain the earliest A\u03b2 and tau AD disease pathologies.

In the present review, we first summarize the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the central nervous system (CNS) and then discuss the associations and potential shared key factors between COVID-19 and AD, with a focus on the ACE2 receptor, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, age, and neuroinflammation.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36309135": {"ArticleTitle": "SOX2 modulates the nuclear organization and transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor.", "AbstractText": "Steroid receptors (SRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors (TFs) relevant to key cellular processes in both physiology and pathology, including some types of cancer. SOX2 is a master TF of pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, and its dysregulation is also associated with various types of human cancers. A potential crosstalk between these TFs could be relevant in malignant cells yet, to the best of our knowledge, no formal study has been performed thus far. Here we show, by quantitative live-cell imaging microscopy, that ectopic expression of SOX2 disrupts the formation of hormone-dependent intranuclear condensates of many steroid receptors (SRs), including those formed by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). SOX2 also reduces GR's binding to specific DNA targets and modulates its transcriptional activity. SOX2-driven effects on GR condensates do not require the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the receptor and, surprisingly, neither relies on GR/SOX2 interactions. SOX2 also alters the intranuclear dynamics and compartmentalization of the SR coactivator NCoA-2 and impairs GR/NCoA-2 interactions. These results suggest an indirect mechanism underlying SOX2-driven effects on SRs involving this coactivator. Together, these results highlight that the transcriptional program elicited by GR relies on its nuclear organization and is intimately linked to the distribution of other GR partners, such as the NCoA-2 coactivator. Abnormal expression of SOX2, commonly observed in many tumors, may alter the biological action of GR and, probably, other SRs as well. Understanding this crosstalk may help to improve steroid hormone-based therapies in cancers with elevated SOX2 expression.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36109050": {"ArticleTitle": "Comparative effect of metformin versus sulfonylureas with dementia and Parkinson's disease risk in US patients over 50 with type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "AbstractText": "Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for dementia and Parkinson's disease (PD). Drug treatments for diabetes, such as metformin, could be used as novel treatments for these neurological conditions. Using electronic health records from the USA (OPTUM EHR) we aimed to assess the association of metformin with all-cause dementia, dementia subtypes and PD compared with sulfonylureas. A new user comparator study design was conducted in patients \u226550 years old with diabetes who were new users of metformin or sulfonylureas between 2006 and 2018. Primary outcomes were all-cause dementia and PD. Secondary outcomes were Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to estimate the HRs. Subanalyses included stratification by age, race, renal function, and glycemic control. We identified 96\u2009140 and 16\u2009451 new users of metformin and sulfonylureas, respectively. Mean age was 66.4\u00b18.2 years (48% male, 83% Caucasian). Over the 5-year follow-up, 3207 patients developed all-cause dementia (2256 (2.3%) metformin, 951 (5.8%) sulfonylurea users) and 760 patients developed PD (625 (0.7%) metformin, 135 (0.8%) sulfonylurea users). After IPTW, HRs for all-cause dementia and PD were 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.88) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.28). HRs for AD, VD and MCI were 0.81 (0.70-0.94), 0.79 (0.63-1.00) and 0.91 (0.79-1.04). Stronger associations were observed in patients who were younger (<75 years old), Caucasian, and with moderate renal function. Metformin users compared with sulfonylurea users were associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, AD and VD but not with PD or MCI. Age and renal function modified risk reduction. Our findings support the hypothesis that metformin provides more neuroprotection for dementia than sulfonylureas but not for PD, but further work is required to assess causality.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36307324": {"ArticleTitle": "[Management of genetic predisposition to hematologic malignancies in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Guidelines from the Francophone Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (SFGM-TC)].", "AbstractText": "The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL) more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family.

We then employed a latent learning paradigm to assess cognitive and motor function followed by neurochemical analysis with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon fiber microelectrodes to measure the electrically stimulated dopamine release. The behavioral assay showed that OKA treatment caused fish to have lower motivation to reach the goal chamber, resulting in impeded learning and decreased locomotor activity compared to controls. Our voltammetric measurements revealed that the peak dopamine overflow in OKA-treated fish was about one-third of that measured in controls. These findings highlight the profound neurochemical changes that may occur in AD.

Here, we report that cancer cells can evade cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis by uptake and catabolism of the cysteine-rich extracellular protein albumin. This protective mechanism is enhanced by mTORC1 inhibition and involves albumin degradation in the lysosome, predominantly by cathepsin B (CTSB). CTSB-dependent albumin breakdown followed by export of cystine from the lysosome via the transporter cystinosin fuels the synthesis of glutathione, which suppresses lethal lipid peroxidation. When cancer cells are grown under non-adherent conditions as spheroids, mTORC1 pathway activity is reduced, and albumin supplementation alone affords considerable protection against ferroptosis.

There is a stepwise molecular progression from well-differentiated carcinoma to HGFCTC to ATC manifested by 1) early and persistent driver alteration in the MAPK pathway, particularly BRAF V600E and RAS mutations, and 2) gain of secondary aggressive molecular signatures (such as TERT promoter and TP53 mutations) when tumors progress from well-differentiated to high grade to anaplastic carcinoma.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36305146": {"ArticleTitle": "Wogonin Restrains the Malignant Progression of Lung Cancer through Modulating MMP1 and PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway.", "AbstractText": "Wogonin, a natural flavonoid compound, represses cancer cell growth and induces cancer cell apoptosis in diverse malignancies.

A549 and H460 cells were treated with Wogonin, and the cell growth, apoptosis, migration and invasion were measured by CCK-8 and EdU, flow cytometry and Transwell assays. The targeted genes of Wogonin and lung cancer were identified from the TCMSP database and Genecards database, respectively. The STRING database and Cytoscape software were used to establish a PPI network and screen hub genes. GO and KEGG analysis were conducted to explore the functions and signal pathway related to the hub genes. MMP1 expression in lung cancer was analyzed using the UALCAN databases, and GSEA was performed utilizing LinkedOmics. Gelatin zymography assay was used to detect MMP1 activity. MMP1 mRMA expression was detected by qRT-PCR. Besides, MMP1, p-AKT and c-Myc protein were detected by Western Blot assay. Wogonin could suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion of A549 and H460 cells, and induce the apoptosis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed the hub genes were mostly enriched in re-entry into mitotic cell cycle and apoptosis. The expression of MMP1 was markedly up-regulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma tissues, as well as lung cancer cell lines. Wogonin could significantly inhibit MMP1 expression and activity, and overexpression of MMP1 significantly reversed the effect of Wogonin on the malignant phenotypes of A549 and H460 cells. Wogonin inhibited the expression of p-AKT and c-Myc protein by regulating MMP1.

According to the molecular docking result, tubulin, and the investigated variants of podophyllotoxin interact more effectively than topoisomerase. The greatest docking score of the compounds was -12.200 against tubulin and -4.511 against topoisomerase, indicating that tubulin is the target of these drugs. Further to ascertain the strength of the interaction between the best-docked derivatives and the target protein, additional molecular dynamics investigations were also incorporated.

This study aimed to synthesize core-shell nanoparticles via green method which utilised crude peels extract of Garcinia mangostana as reducing and stabilising agents for drug delivery. Gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles (Au-AgNPs) were synthesized through seed germination process in which gold nanoparticles acted as the seed. A complete coating was observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) when the ratio of AuNPs and AgNPs was 1:9. The size of Au-AgNPs was 38.22 \u00b1 8.41\u00a0nm and was mostly spherical in shape. Plant-based drug, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was loaded on the Au-AgNPs to investigate their anticancer activity. In HCT116 colon cancer cells, PCA-loaded Au-AgNPs (IC50 = 10.78\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) showed higher inhibitory action than the free PCA (IC50= 148.09\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and Au-AgNPs alone (IC50= 24.36\u00a0\u03bcg/ml).

We aimed to determine the relevance of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the development of NASH induced by CCl4 along with an hepatopathogenic diet in male Wistar rats.

Liver steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were evaluated using biochemical, histological, ultrastructural, and immunofluorescence analyses, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Our experimental model reproduced several aspects of the human NASH pathophysiology. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was induced by the combined effect of HFSCD plus CCl4 and significantly increased levels of both proinflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines and collagen deposition in the liver; thus, NASH severity was higher in the HFSCD+CCl4 group than that in the HFSCD group, to which CCl4 was not administered. Hepatic stellate cells, the most profibrogenic cells, were activated by HFSCD plus CCl4, as indicated by elevated levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin.

Further, we used microarray analysis to identify changes in the gene expression profile of HESCs treated with BSG small interfering RNA (siRNA). All experiments were repeated at least three times. The effect of BSG knockdown (using siRNA) on HESC proliferation was determined by counting cell number and by tritiated thymidine incorporation assays. The effect of BSG on decidualization of HESCs was determined by RT-qPCR for the decidualization markers insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and prolactin (PRL). Immunoblotting was used to determine the effect of BSG siRNA on the expression of MMP-2,3. Microarray analysis was used to identify BSG-regulated genes in HESCs at Day 6 of decidualization.

Most of the findings were obtained using an in vitro cell culture system that may not necessarily reflect in vivo functions. Our results demonstrate that BSG plays a vital role in decidualization and that downregulation of BSG in the uterine endometrium may be associated with infertility in women.

We present the analysis of a multicenter, retrospective, series of EP-NETs G1-G2 recurring after radical resection and with histological re-evaluation at disease recurrence (DR). The primary endpoint was the description of Ki-67 change at DR compared to time of surgery. The secondary endpoint was assessment of recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates. In total, 47 patients had a second histological evaluation and could be included in the present study. Median Ki-67 at surgery was 3% (range 1-15%) but, at DR, a significant increase in the value was observed (7%, range 1-30%; p\u2009<\u2009.01) and involved 66.0% of cases, with a corresponding increase in tumor grading in 34.0% (p\u00a0=\u00a0.05).

We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1\u00a0h (2 puffs/min, 100\u00a0ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only.

Secretase processing of mutant BRI2 leads to secretion and deposition of BRI2-derived amyloidogenic peptides, ABri and ADan that resemble APP/\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) pathology, which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid pathology in FBD/FDD manifests itself predominantly in the microvasculature by ABri/ADan containing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). While ABri and ADan peptide sequences differ only in a few C-terminal amino acids, CAA in FDD is characterized by co-aggregation of ADan with A\u03b2, while in contrast no A\u03b2 deposition is observed in FBD. The fact that FDD patients display an earlier and more severe disease onset than FBD suggests a potential role of ADan and A\u03b2 co-aggregation that promotes a more rapid disease progression in FDD compared to FBD. It is therefore critical to delineate the chemical signatures of amyloid aggregation in these two vascular dementias. This in turn will increase the knowledge on the pathophysiology of these diseases and the pathogenic role of heterogenous amyloid peptide interactions and deposition, respectively. Herein, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) in combination with hyperspectral, confocal microscopy based on luminescent conjugated oligothiophene probes (LCO) to delineate the structural traits and associated amyloid peptide patterns of single CAA in postmortem brain tissue of patients with FBD, FDD as well as sporadic CAA without AD (CAA+) that show pronounced CAA without parenchymal plaques. The results show that CAA in both FBD and FDD consist of N-terminally truncated- and pyroglutamate-modified amyloid peptide species (ADan and ABri), but that ADan peptides in FDD are also extensively C-terminally truncated as compared to ABri in FBD, which contributes to hydrophobicity of ADan species. Further, CAA in FDD showed co-deposition with A\u03b2 x-42 and A\u03b2 x-40 species. CAA+ vessels were structurally more mature than FDD/FBD CAA and contained significant amounts of pyroglutamated A\u03b2. When compared with FDD, A\u03b2 in CAA+ showed more C-terminal and less N-terminally truncations. In FDD, ADan showed spatial co-localization with A\u03b23pE-40 and A\u03b23-40 but not with A\u03b2x-42 species. This suggests an increased aggregation propensity of A\u03b2 in FDD that promotes co-aggregation of both A\u03b2 and ADan. Further, CAA maturity appears to be mainly governed by A\u03b2 content based on the significantly higher 500/580 patterns observed in CAA+ than in FDD and FBD, respectively. Together this is the first study of its kind on comprehensive delineation of Bri2 and APP-derived amyloid peptides in single vascular plaques in both FDD/FBD and sporadic CAA that provides new insight in non-AD-related vascular amyloid pathology.

The underpinning of such complex behaviors is social memory, namely the capacity to discriminate between familiar and novel individuals. The Medial Septum (MS), a region localized in the basal forebrain, is part of the brain network involved in social memory formation. MS receives several cortical and subcortical synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs that make it an important hub in processing social information relevant for social memory. Particular attention is paid to synaptic inputs that control both the MS and the CA2 region of the hippocampus, one of the major MS output, that has been causally linked to social memory. In this review article, we will provide an overview of local and long range connectivity that allows MS to integrate and process social information. Furthermore, we will summarize previous strategies used to determine how MS controls social memory in different animal species. Finally, we will discuss the impact of an altered MS signaling on social memory in animal models and patients affected by neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism and Alzheimer's Disease.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36308836": {"ArticleTitle": "2D carbon materials based photoelectrochemical biosensors for detection of cancer antigens.", "AbstractText": "Cancer is a leading cause of death globally and early diagnosis is of paramount importance for identifying appropriate treatment pathways to improve cancer patient survival. However, conventional methods for cancer detection such as biopsy, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopy, X-ray and ultrasound are limited and not efficient for early cancer detection. Advancements in molecular technology have enabled the identification of various cancer biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of the deadly disease. The detection of these biomarkers can be done by biosensors. Biosensors are less time consuming compared to conventional methods and has the potential to detect cancer at an earlier stage. Compared to conventional biosensors, photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors have improved selectivity and sensitivity and is a suitable tool for detecting cancer agents. Recently, 2D carbon materials have gained interest as a PEC sensing platform due to their high surface area and ease of surface modifications for improved electrical transfer and attachment of biorecognition elements. This review will focus on the development of 2D carbon nanomaterials as electrode platform in PEC biosensors for the detection of cancer biomarkers. The working principles, biorecognition strategies and key parameters that influence the performance of the biosensors will be critically discussed.

QoL data were collected from survivors recruited in France and Belgium between 2012-2017, including the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the Quality of Life Systemic Inventory (QLSI). The Wilcoxon test was used to compare SF-12 scale scores between survivors and matched population controls. For the QLSI, comparisons were mainly descriptive. 186 survivors (mean age: 27.6 years; range: 18.1-52.8) at follow-up completed QoL measures, amongst whom 180 were matched to controls. Overall, survivors had higher QoL on all SF12 scale scores, indicating that they had better functioning compared to controls. Statistically significant differences on the SF12 were observed for Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Limitations due to Emotional Problems and Mental Health scales.

Nowadays, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies in the management of oncological diseases is becoming increasingly important. With the advancement of software technologies, improvements have been made in the early diagnosis of risk groups in oncological diseases, in radiology, pathology, and imaging technologies, in cancer staging and management. In addition, these technologies can be used to predict the outcome in chemotherapy treatment of oncological diseases. In this context, this study identifies artificial intelligence and machine learning methods used in the prediction of complications due to chemotherapeutic agents used in childhood cancer treatment. For this purpose, the concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning are explained in this review. A general framework for the use of machine learning in healthcare and pediatric oncology has been drawn and examples of studies conducted on this topic in pediatric oncology have been given. IMPACT: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are advanced tools that can be used to predict chemotherapy-related complications.

We tested the hypothesis that increased vascular collagen-IV associates with clinical hypertension and with SVD in older persons and with chronic hypertension in young and aged primates and genetically hypertensive rats. We quantified vascular collagen-IV immunolabeling in small arteries in a cohort of older persons with minimal Alzheimer's pathology (N=52; 21F/31M, age 82.8\u00b16.95 years).

We also compared genetically hypertensive and normotensive rats (aged 10-12 months). Collagen-IV immunolabeling in cerebral small arteries of older persons was negatively associated with radiological SVD severity (\u03c1: -0.427, P=0.005) but was not related to history of hypertension. General linear models confirmed the negative association of lower collagen-IV with radiological SVD (P<0.017), including age as a covariate and either clinical hypertension (P<0.030) or neuropathological SVD diagnosis (P<0.022) as fixed factors.

In young and aged primates, brain collagen-IV was elevated in older normotensive relative to young normotensive animals (P=0.029) but was not associated with hypertension. Genetically hypertensive rats did not differ from normotensive rats in terms of arterial collagen-IV. Our cross-species data provide novel insight into sporadic SVD pathogenesis, supporting insufficient (rather than excessive) arterial collagen-IV in SVD, accompanied by matrix remodeling with elevated fibrillar collagen deposition.

A combination of localized heating and free radicals can effectively kill tumor cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The tumor cell death caused by the combination of magnetic heating and free radicals led to the release or exposure of various damage-associated molecule patterns, which promoted the maturation of dendritic cells.

Clinical, demographical, ophthalmological and OCT-A data from the Neuro-ophthalmology Research at Fundaci\u00f3 ACE (NORFACE) project were analyzed. Differences of macular VD in four quadrants (superior, nasal, inferior and temporal) among the five diagnostic groups were assessed in a multivariate regression model, adjusted by age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease and stroke. The study cohort comprised 672 participants: 128 CU, 120 MCI-AD, 111 MCI-Va, 257 ADD and 56 VaD. Regression analysis showed a significantly higher VD in the temporal quadrant in MCI-AD compared to CU participants (49.05\u2009\u00b1\u20094.91 vs 47.27\u2009\u00b1\u20094.17, p\u2009=\u20090.02, d\u2009=\u20090.40), and a significantly lower VD in the inferior quadrant in MCI-Va compared to CU participants (48.70\u2009\u00b1\u20096.57 vs 51.27\u2009\u00b1\u20096.39, p\u2009=\u20090.02, d\u2009=\u20090.40). Individuals with heart disease presented significantly lower VD in the inferior quadrant than those without (p\u2009=\u20090.01).

In conclusion, our study showed that the MCI-AD and MCI-Va groups had significant differences in macular VD in opposite directions in the temporal and inferior quadrants, respectively, compared to CU participants, suggesting that macular VD might be able to differentiate two pathogenic pathways (AD- and cerebrovascular-related) in early stages of cognitive decline.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36305663": {"ArticleTitle": "Commentary on the First-Line Support for Assistance in Breathing in Children Trials on Noninvasive Respiratory Support: Taking a Closer Look.", "AbstractText": "Noninvasive respiratory support modalities such as high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are used frequently in pediatric critical care to support acutely ill children with respiratory failure (step-up management) and children following extubation (step-down management). Although there are several observational studies and database analyses comparing the efficacy of HFNC and CPAP, and a few small randomized clinical trials (RCTs), until recently, there were no large RCTs comparing the two modalities in a mixed group of critically ill children. In the first half of 2022, results from the First-Line Support for Assistance in Breathing in Children (FIRST-ABC) trials were published; these comprised a master protocol of two trials: one in acutely ill children (step-up RCT) and one in extubated children (step-down RCT). Each of these pragmatic trials randomized 600 children to either HFNC or CPAP when the treating clinician decided that noninvasive respiratory support beyond standard oxygen therapy was required. The primary outcome was time to liberation from all forms of respiratory support (invasive and noninvasive), excluding supplemental oxygen. The FIRST-ABC trials represent a significant advance in the field of noninvasive respiratory support, which has traditionally been evidence-poor and associated with considerable variability in clinical practice.

Emerging evidence highlighted that hyperglycemia and brain insulin resistance represent risk factors for AD development, thus suggesting the existence of an additional AD form, associated with glucose metabolism impairment, named type 3 diabetes. Owing to the limited pharmacological options, novel strategies, especially dietary approaches based on the consumption of polyphenols, have been addressed to prevent or, at least, slow down AD progression. Among polyphenols, ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative, widely distributed in nature, especially in cereal bran and fruits, and known to be endowed with many bioactivities, especially antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic, thus suggesting it could be exploited as a possible novel neuroprotective strategy. Considering the importance of ferulic acid as a bioactive molecule and its widespread distribution in foods and medicinal plants, the aim of the present narrative review is to provide an overview on the existing preclinical and clinical evidence about the neuroprotective properties and mechanisms of action of ferulic acid, also focusing on its ability to modulate glucose homeostasis, in order to support a further therapeutic interest for AD and type 3 diabetes.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36155523": {"ArticleTitle": "Quality of Life and the Experience of Living with Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "There is a need to better understand the experience of patients living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the early stages.

Rates of early trial termination appeared stable over the study. Statistically significant univariate predictors of early termination for any reason include cancer category, phase, funding source, location, and age. In multivariable analysis, trials spanning multiple cancer categories and international trials were less likely to terminate early whereas phase 2 trials and trials funded by academia/foundation were more likely to terminate early. The most common reason for early termination was \"Other, Multiple Reasons, or Unknown\" (36.9%), followed by accrual issues (34.5%). In multivariate analysis among all terminated trials, supportive care trials, phase 2 trials, and non-industry funded trials had significantly higher odds of trial discontinuation specifically due to poor accrual.

Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have established that E2F4 can also play a relevant role in cell and tissue homeostasis, as well as tissue regeneration. For these non-canonical functions, E2F4 can also act in the cytoplasm, where it is able to interact with many homeostatic and synaptic regulators. Since E2F4 is expressed in the nervous system, it may fulfill a crucial role in brain function and homeostasis, being a promising multifactorial target for neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging. The regulation of E2F4 is complex, as it can be chemically modified through acetylation, from which we present evidence in the brain, as well as methylation, and phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of E2F4 within a conserved threonine motif induces cell cycle re-entry in neurons, while a dominant negative form of E2F4 (E2F4DN), in which the conserved threonines have been substituted by alanines, has been shown to act as a multifactorial therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We generated transgenic mice neuronally expressing E2F4DN. We have recently shown using this mouse strain that expression of E2F4DN in 5xFAD mice, a known murine model of AD, improved cognitive function, reduced neuronal tetraploidization, and induced a transcriptional program consistent with modulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide proteostasis and brain homeostasis recovery. 5xFAD/E2F4DN mice also showed reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 3-6 months of age. Here, we analyzed the immune response in 1 year-old 5xFAD/E2F4DN mice, concluding that reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis is maintained at this late stage. In addition, the expression of E2F4DN also reduced age-associated microgliosis in wild-type mice, thus stressing its role as a brain homeostatic agent.

The fact that the cofactor is best bound to the active site inspired us to explore its interactions to LSD1/CoREST enzyme complex utilizing molecular dynamics simulation, which aids designing novel and potent inhibitors. In this study we minted to identify a new potential LSD1/CoREST inhibitors and test the potency and the safety of such inhibitors against human neuroblastoma and fibroblast cells lines. We have implemented a previously derived model from the molecular dynamics simulation study and the key contacts to the active site in a subsequent structure based drug design and in-silico screening, which revealed a number of potential inhibitors toward LSD1/CoREST complex. The anti-proliferative activities of the identified compounds will be tested against neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cancer cell line which known to highly express LSD1/CoREST complex. In-silico mining on National Cancer Institute (NCI) database identified 55 promising and structurally diverse inhibitors. Applying the abovementioned molecular modeling procedure yielded four compounds of LSD1/CoREST inhibiters with IC50 < 2\u00b5M. The four lead compounds were tested against SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line that known to express high level of LSD1 and illustrated a potent activity with an IC50 ranging from 0.195 to 1.52\u00b5M. To estimate the toxicity of the selective leads, they were tested against normal fibroblast cells and scored a relatively high IC50 ranging from 0.303 to \u2265 100\u00b5M.

This virus can invade human cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-based mechanisms, affecting the human respiratory tract. However, several reports of neurological symptoms suggest a neuroinvasive development of coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 can damage the brain via several routes, along with direct neural cell infection with the coronavirus. The chronic inflammatory reactions surge the brain with proinflammatory elements, damaging the neural cells, causing brain ischemia associated with other health issues. SARS-CoV-2 exhibited neuropsychiatric and neurological manifestations, including cognitive impairment, depression, dizziness, delirium, and disturbed sleep. These symptoms show nervous tissue damage that enhances the occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders and aids dementia. SARS-CoV-2 has been seen in brain necropsy and isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients. The associated inflammatory reaction in some COVID-19 patients has increased proinflammatory cytokines, which have been investigated as a prognostic factor. Therefore, the immunogenic changes observed in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients include their pathogenetic role. Inflammatory events have been an important pathophysiological feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The neuroinflammation observed in AD has exacerbated the A\u03b2 burden and tau hyperphosphorylation. The resident microglia and other immune cells are responsible for the enhanced burden of A\u03b2 and subsequently mediate tau phosphorylation and ultimately disease progression. Similarly, neuroinflammation also plays a key role in the progression of PD. Several studies have demonstrated an interplay between neuroinflammation and pathogenic mechanisms of PD. The dynamic proinflammation stage guides the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein and neurodegenerative progression. Besides, few viruses may have a role as stimulators and generate a cross-autoimmune response for \u03b1-synuclein. Hence, neurological complications in patients suffering from COVID-19 cannot be ruled out.

Multidrug therapy is more efficient in such patients compared to monodrug therapy. Simultaneous combinatorial or co-delivery garnered significant interest in the past years. Caffeic acid (CFA) (a natural polyphenol) has received growing attention because of its anticarcinogenic and antioxidant potential. Bortezomib (BTZ) is a proteasome inhibitor and may be explored for treating breast cancer. Despite its high anticancer activity, the low water solubility and chemical instability restrict its efficacy against solid tumors. In the present study, we designed and investigated a HP-PCL (N-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide-polycaprolactone) polymeric micellar (PMCs) system for the simultaneous delivery of BTZ and CFA in the treatment of breast cancer. The designed BTZ+CFA-HP-PCL PMCs were fabricated, optimized, and characterized for size, zeta potential, surface morphology, and in vitro drug release. Developed nanosized (174.6 \u00b1 0.24 nm) PMCs showed enhanced cellular internalization and cell cytotoxicity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels were highest in BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs, while CFA-HP-PCL PMCs significantly (p < 0.001) scavenged the ROS generated in 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay revealed intense and significant green fluorescence in both types of cancer cells when treated with BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs (p < 0.001) indicating apoptosis or cell death. The pharmacokinetic studies revealed that BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs and BTZ+CFA-HP-PCL PMCs exhibited the highest bioavailability, enhanced plasma half-life, decreased volume of distribution, and lower clearance rate than the pure combination of drugs. In the organ biodistribution studies, the combination of BTZ+CFA showed higher distribution in the spleen and the heart. Overall findings of in vitro studies surprisingly resulted in better therapeutic efficiency of BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs than BTZ+CFA-HP-PCL PMCs.

Alongside the conventional A\u03b2 and tau hypotheses, neuroinflammation and metabolism disruption have also been regarded as crucial hallmarks of AD. In this study, a novel Chinese formula Nao Tan Qing (NTQ) was developed and shown to improve AD. In vivo experiments showed that NTQ significantly mitigated cognitive impairment, A\u03b2 burden and neuroinflammation in a transgenic AD mouse model (5\u00d7FAD). Network pharmacology results revealed that the active components of NTQ could target inflammatory and metabolic pathways. In addition, hippocampal transcriptomics suggested that NTQ regulated signaling pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Consistently, serum metabolomics further indicated that NTQ could modulate glycolipid metabolism. In summary, a combination of systems pharmacology analysis and biological validation study demonstrates that NTQ could alleviate behavioral abnormality and pathological alterations of AD by targeting glycolipid metabolism and neuroinflammation, and is accordingly a potential therapeutic agent for AD.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36305098": {"ArticleTitle": "Identification of Cofilin-1 as a novel biomarker of atopic dermatitis using iTRAQ quantitative proteomics.", "AbstractText": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin condition; however, little is known about the pathogenesis and serum biomarker of this disease.

It is characterized by two pathological hallmarks, the extracellular deposits of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and the intraneuronal deposits of Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Yet, those two hallmarks do not explain the full pathology seen with AD, suggesting the involvement of other mechanisms. Neuroinflammation could offer another explanation for the progression of the disease. This review provides an overview of recent advances on the role of the immune cells' microglia and astrocytes in neuroinflammation. In AD, microglia and astrocytes become reactive by several mechanisms leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines that cause further neuronal damage.

We pooled Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores using a random-effects model via RevMan 5.4 software. We calculated estimates of mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcomes were pre-post treatment changes in global cognition as measured using MMSE and ADAS-Cog immediately after rTMS treatment, and the secondary outcome was duration of cognitive improvement (1-1.5 and \u22653 months). Nine studies with 361 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that rTMS significantly improved global cognitive function immediately following rTMS treatment [(MD) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-2.22, p < 0.00001, MMSE; 2.72, 95% CI, 1.77-3.67, p < 0.00001, ADAS-Cog], and the therapeutic effects persisted for an extended duration (2.20, 95% CI, 0.93-3.47, p =0.0007, MMSE; 1.96, 95% CI, 0.96-2.95, p = 0.0001, ADAS-Cog). Subgroup analyses showed that high frequency rTMS targeted to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for over 20 sessions induced the greatest cognitive improvement, with effects lasting for more than 1 month after the final treatment. There were no significant differences in dropout rate (p > 0.05) or adverse effect rate (p > 0.05) between the rTMS and control groups. Repetitive TMS is a potentially effective treatment for cognitive impairment in AD that is safe and can induce long-lasting effects.

Methods Through a systematic search of nine databases (Web of science, PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang) from the inception to April, 2021, observational studies with bilingual and monolingual older adults as participants and cognitive function scores as outcome measures were included. Two reviewers independently completed the selection and methodological quality assessment of studies using the JBI cross-sectional study quality evaluation tool, and used a pre-designed table for data extraction and sorting. Results Fourteen studies with 51 tasks were included, involving 3737 participants (bilingual group: 1695, monolingual group: 2042).

However, the precise mechanism by which natural polyphenols regulate telomerase activity remains unclear. Recent research indicates that NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) are involved in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) regulation. Thus, in order to better comprehend the mechanism by which polyphenols regulate hTERT, the present study investigated the effects of the natural polyphenols Resveratrol, Gallic acid, and Kuromanin chloride on hTERT, Nrf2, and SIRT1 expression as well as oxidative stress in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma. The trypan blue dye exclusion assay was used to assess cell viability. The level of mRNA for hTERT, Nrf2, and SIRT1 was then determined using real-time PCR. A spectrophotometric analysis was conducted to quantify oxidative stress markers. The results demonstrated that Resveratrol induces the expression of hTERT and the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Gallic acid at concentrations of 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcM also increased the expression of the hTERT and SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, dose-dependent overexpression of hTERT and Nrf2 was induced by Kuromanin chloride at 10 and 20\u00a0\u00b5M. Moreover, we found that Resveratrol and Kuromanin chloride ameliorated oxidative stress, whereas Gallic acid exacerbated it. This study demonstrates that low doses of polyphenols (Resveratrol, Gallic acid, and Kuromanin chloride) upregulate the expression of the hTERT gene in the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, possibly via induction of the SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, by targeting this pathway or hTERT, the anti-cancer effect of polyphenols can be enhanced.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36307322": {"ArticleTitle": "[MEN for multiple endocrin neoplasms: When evokate MEN?

The presence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology was determined by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Eighty-five subjects with a mean age of 70 (\u00b1\u20097.4) years, 62% female and 54% with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia were included. We found 15 plasma proteins with altered baseline levels in participants with NPS (NPI-Q score >\u20090). Adding those 15 proteins to a reference model based on clinical data (age, CDR-SoB) significantly improved the prediction of NPS (from receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) 0.75 to AUC 0.91, p =\u20090.004) with a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 74%. The identified proteins additionally predicted both persisting NPS and cognitive decline at follow-up visits. The observed associations were independent of the presence of AD pathology. Using proteomics, we identified a panel of specific blood proteins associated with current and future NPS, and related cognitive decline in older people.

With its outstanding role as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, alongside its anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, the artichoke can be implemented in a multi-targeted approach in AD therapy. Moreover, artichoke agricultural wastes can represent according to the current United Nations Sustainable Development goals an opportunity to produce medicinally valuable phenolic-rich extracts. In this context, the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS phytochemical characterization of artichoke bracts extract revealed the presence of mono- and di-caffeoylquinic acids and apigenin, luteolin, and kaempferol O-glycosides with remarkable total phenolics and flavonoids contents. A broad antioxidant spectrum was established in vitro. Artichoke-loaded, chitosan-coated, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were prepared and characterized for their size, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency, release, and ex vivo permeation and showed suitable colloidal characteristics, a controlled release profile, and promising ex vivo permeation, indicating possibly better physicochemical and biopharmaceutical parameters than free artichoke extract. The anti-Alzheimer potential of the extract and prepared SLNs was assessed in vivo in streptozotocin-induced sporadic Alzheimer mice. A great improvement in cognitive functions and spatial memory recovery, in addition to a marked reduction of the inflammatory biomarker TNF-\u03b1, \u03b2-amyloid, and tau protein levels, were observed. Significant neuroprotective efficacy in dentate Gyrus sub-regions was achieved in mice treated with free artichoke extract and to a significantly higher extent with artichoke-loaded SLNs.

Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between TNBC and normal breast tissues were stringently selected, verified, and externally validated. A machine-learning algorithm was applied to select the top DMRs, which then were evaluated on plasma-derived circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples of TNBC patients and healthy controls. We identified 23 DMRs accounting for the methylation profile of blood cells and reference mammary cells and then selected six top DMRs for cfDNA analysis. We quantified un-/methylated copies of these DMRs by droplet digital PCR analysis in a plasma test set from TNBC patients and healthy controls and confirmed our findings obtained on tissues. Differential cfDNA methylation was confirmed in an independent validation set of plasma samples. A methylation score combining signatures of the top three DMRs overlapping with the SPAG6, LINC10606, and TBCD/ZNF750 genes had the best capability to discriminate TNBC patients from controls (AUC=0.78 in the test set and AUC=0.74 in validation set).

Using MRI data from a previously defined selection of this cohort, we derived brain-predicted age from an established machine-learning model (trained on 2001 healthy adults aged 18-90 years); subtracting this from chronological age (at time of assessment) gave the brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD). We tested associations with data from early life, midlife, and late life, as well as rates of MRI-derived brain atrophy. Between May 28, 2015, and Jan 10, 2018, 502 individuals were assessed as part of Insight 46.

In general, large-scale circRNA BSJ detection is performed based on RNA sequencing data, followed by the selection and validation of circRNAs of interest using RT-qPCR with circRNA-specific PCR primers. Such a primer pair is convergent and functional on the circRNA template but divergent and non-functional on the linear host gene. Although a few circRNA primer design pipelines have been published, none of them offer large-scale, easy-to-use circRNA primer design. Other limitations are that these tools generally do not take into account assay specificity, secondary structures, and SNPs in the primer annealing regions. Furthermore, these tools are limited to circRNA primer design for humans (no other organisms possible), and no wet-lab validation is demonstrated. Here, we present CIRCprimerXL, a circRNA RT-qPCR assay design pipeline based on the primer design framework primerXL. CIRCprimerXL takes a circRNA BSJ position as input, and designs BSJ-spanning primers using Primer3. The user can choose to use the unspliced or spliced circRNA sequence as template. Prior to primer design, sequence regions with secondary structures and common SNPs are flagged. Next, the primers are filtered based on predicted specificity and the absence of secondary structures of the amplicon to select a suitable primer pair. Our tool is both available as a user-friendly web tool and as a stand-alone pipeline based on Docker and Nextflow, allowing users to run the pipeline on a wide range of computer infrastructures. The CIRCprimerXL Nextflow pipeline can be used to design circRNA primers for any species by providing the appropriate reference genome. The CIRCprimerXL web tool supports circRNA primer design for human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, Xenopus tropicalis, and C. elegans. The design process can easily be scaled up for the qPCR assay design of tens of thousands of circRNAs within a couple of hours. We show how CIRCprimerXL has been successfully used to design qPCR assays for over 15,000 human circRNAs of which 20 were empirically validated.

AD brain sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were greatly enriched with A\u03b242 at almost equimolar levels to N-terminal truncated microtubule binding region (MTBR) isoforms of tau with multiple site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). MTBR R3 and R4 tau peptides were most abundant in the sarkosyl-insoluble materials with a 10-fold higher concentration than N-terminal tau peptides. This indicates that the major proportion of the enriched tau was the aggregation prone N-terminal and proline rich region (PRR) of truncated mixed 4R and 3R tau with more 4R than 3R isoforms. High concentration and occupancies of site-specific phosphorylation pT181 (~\u200922 %) and pT217 (~\u200916 %) (key biomarkers of AD) along with other PTMs in the PRR and MTBR indicated a regional susceptibility of PTMs in aggregated tau. Immunogold labelling revealed that tau may exist in globular non-filamentous form (N-terminal intact tau) co-localized with A\u03b2 in the sarkosyl-insoluble pellets along with tau filaments (N-truncated MTBR tau). Our results suggest a model that A\u03b2 and tau interact forming globular aggregates, from which filamentous tau and A\u03b2 emerge. These characterizations contribute towards unravelling the sequence of events which lead to end-stage AD changes.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36284365": {"ArticleTitle": "The RyR-calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 protects hippocampal neurons from GABAergic synaptic alterations induced by Abeta42 oligomers.", "AbstractText": "Amyloid beta 42 peptide (Abeta42) accumulation is a key characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and causes synaptic dysfunctions. To date, the effects of Abeta42 accumulation on GABAergic synapses are poorly understood Our findings suggest that, similarly to what observed on glutamatergic synapses, Abeta42 modifies GABAergic synapses by targeting ryanodine receptors and causing calcium dysregulation The GABAergic impairments can be restored by the RyR-calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 Based on our research, RyRs stabilization may represent a novel pharmaceutical strategy for preventing or delaying of AD. Oligomeric form of amyloid beta protein Abeta42 contributes to the development of synaptic abnormalities and cognitive impairments associated with AD. To date, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how Abeta42 alters the elementary parameters of GABAergic synaptic function. Here we found that Abeta42 increased the frequency and amplitude of miniature GABAergic currents as well as the amplitude of evoked inhibitory post synaptic currents (eIPSCs). When we focused on paired pulse depression (PPD) to establish whether GABA release probability (p) was affected by Abeta42, we did not observe any significant change. On the other hand, a more detailed investigation of the presynaptic effects induced by Abeta42 by means of multiple probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) and cumulative amplitude analysis shown an increased size of both the readily releasable pool responsible for synchronous release (RRPsyn ) and the number of release sites (N). We further explored whether ryanodine receptors (RyRs) contributed to exacerbate these changes by stabilizing the interaction between RyRs and the accessory protein calstabin. We observed that the RyRs calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 restored the synaptic parameters to values comparable to those measured in control conditions. In conclusion, our results clarify the mechanisms of potentiation of GABAergic synapses induced by Abeta42. We further suggest that RyRs are involved in the control of synaptic activity during the early stage of AD onset and that their stabilization could represent a new therapeutical approach for AD treatment. Abstract figure legend Left: pre- and postsynaptic neurons are represented under physiological conditions. At rest, ER membrane contains RyRs in closed state and the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous is shifted towards the asynchronous. Middle: Abeta42 causes calcium dysregulation by targeting RyRs which assume a leaky conformation. Abeta42 potentiates the synchronous release and increases the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous, leaving unaltered the size of RRP total. The number of release sites and the number of GABAergic receptors at the postsynaptic membrane are both increased by Abeta42. Right: S107, a RyCal compound, counteracts the effects induced by Abeta42 on GABAergic synapses by stabilizing RyRs in a close conformational configuration, recovering the size of RRP asynchronous and decreasing the number of release sites.

In Homo sapiens, the major sources of LPSs are gastrointestinal (GI)-tract-resident facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, including Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli. LPSs have been abundantly detected in aged human brain by multiple independent research investigators, and an increased abundance of LPSs around and within Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected neurons has been found. Microbiome-generated LPSs and other endotoxins cross GI-tract biophysiological barriers into the systemic circulation and across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, a pathological process that increases during aging and in vascular disorders, including 'leaky gut syndrome'. Further evidence indicates that LPSs up-regulate pro-inflammatory transcription factor complex NF-kB (p50/p65) and subsequently a set of NF-kB-sensitive microRNAs, including miRNA-30b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155. These up-regulated miRNAs in turn down-regulate a family of neurodegeneration-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, including the mRNA encoding the neuron-specific neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein. While NF-L has been reported to be up-regulated in peripheral biofluids in AD and other progressive and lethal pro-inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders, NF-L is significantly down-regulated within neocortical neurons, and this may account for neuronal atrophy, loss of axonal caliber and alterations in neuronal cell shape, modified synaptic architecture and network deficits in neuronal signaling capacity. This paper reviews and reveals the most current findings on the neurotoxic aspects of LPSs and how these pro-inflammatory glycolipids contribute to the biological mechanism of progressive, age-related and ultimately lethal neurodegenerative disorders.

Intracellular accumulation of aggregated A\u03b2 in the CA1 pyramidal cells at 9 months preceded extracellular plaques that first presented in the CA1 at 16 months of age. In biochemical assays, brain glutathione (GSH) declined with age in both 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic controls, but the decline was accelerated in 3xTg-AD brains from 2 to 4 months. The decline in GSH correlated exponentially with the rise in iA\u03b2. Integrated metabolic signaling as the ratio of phospho-Akt (pAkt) to total Akt (tAkt) in the PI3kinase and mTOR pathway declined at 6, 9, and 12 months, before rising at 16 and 20 months. These pAkt/tAkt ratios correlated with both iA\u03b2 and GSH levels in a U-shaped relationship.

Some evidence indicates that the nutritional status of these retinoids (i.e., the presence or absence of deficiency) is able to modulate thyroid gland metabolism. Vitamin A deficiency is tightly correlated with structural and functional impairment of the thyroid gland and is often associated with iodine deficiency. Furthermore, retinoids are involved in different immune functions, as well as in the process of activation, proliferation, and differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg). This is particularly significant given the high prevalence of thyroid autoimmune disorders, whose pathogenesis seems to be related to the altered homeostasis of regulatory T cells. Retinoids are also involved in the modulation of gene expression via their interaction with nuclear receptors, and they also act as cofactors in cell growth and differentiation. The ability of retinoic acid to increase iodine uptake and sodium-iodine symporter activity in human thyroid cancer cell lines suggests that some retinoids and their derivatives may be of use in the treatment of different thyroid tumors.

The risk score was an independent risk factor even when age, sex, and tumor stage were considered.

Immunotoxins based on antigen recognition of single-chain antibodies have been widely explored for cancer therapy. Despite their impressive killing effect on tumor cells, immunotoxins still display unspecific toxicity with undesired side effects. High levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) are well-known indicators of hypoxia in cancer cells. In this study, different linkers were employed to fuse the immunotoxin DAB389-4D5 scFv (DS) with the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD) of HIF-1\u03b1, a domain selectively facilitating the accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxia, to construct the oxygen-dependent degradable immunotoxin DS-ODDD (DSO). The engineered fusion protein DSO-2 containing a linker (G4S)3 possesses the best killing effect on cancer cells under hypoxia and displayed considerably reduced nonspecific toxicity to normal cells under normoxic conditions. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that DSO-2 was degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulated by the oxygen-sensitive mechanism. Western blot analysis indicated that the degradation of DSO-2 significantly decreased the activation of apoptosis-related molecules in normal cells.

Biomarkers derived from DNA methylation (DNAm) offer potential mechanistic insights into human health differences, connecting disease pathogenesis and biological ageing. However, little is known about sensitive periods during the life course where air pollution might have a stronger impact on DNAm, or whether effects accumulate over time. We examined associations between air pollution exposure across the life course and DNAm-based markers of biological ageing. Data were derived from the Scotland-based Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Participants' residential history was linked to annual levels of fine particle (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) around 1935, 1950, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2001; pollutant concentrations were estimated using the EMEP4UK atmospheric chemistry transport model. Blood samples were obtained between ages of 70 and 80\u00a0years, and Horvath DNAmAge, Hannum DNAmAge, DNAmPhenoAge, DNAmGrimAge, and DNAm telomere length (DNAmTL) were computed. We applied the structured life-course modelling approach: least angle regression identified best-fit life-course models for a composite measure of air pollution (air quality index [AQI]), and mixed-effects regression estimated selected models for AQI and single pollutants. We included 525 individuals with 1782 observations. In the total sample, increased air pollution around 1970 was associated with higher epigenetic age (AQI: b\u00a0=\u00a00.322\u00a0year, 95\u00a0%CI: 0.088, 0.555) measured with Horvath DNAmAge in late adulthood.

We herein illustrate a clinical application of Covid-death mean-imputation (CoDMI) algorithm in LARC patients with Covid-19 infection. We analyzed 94 patients treated for primary LARC. Overall survival was calculated in months from diagnosis to first event (last follow-up/death). Because Covid-19 death events potentially bias survival estimation, to eliminate skewed data due to Covid-19 death events, the observed lifetime of Covid-19 cases was replaced by its corresponding expected lifetime in absence of the Covid-19 event using the CoDMI algorithm. Patients who died of Covid-19 (DoC) are mean-imputed by the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Under this approach, the observed lifetime of each DoC patient is considered as an \"incomplete data\" and is extended by an additional expected lifetime computed using the classical Kaplan-Meier model. Sixteen patients were dead of disease (DoD), 1 patient was DoC and 77 cases were censored (Cen). The DoC patient died of Covid-19 52 months after diagnosis. The CoDMI algorithm computed the expected future lifetime provided by the Kaplan-Meier estimator applied to the no-DoC observations as well as to the DoC data itself. Given the DoC event at 52 months, the CoDMI algorithm estimated that this patient would have died after 79.5 months of follow-up. The CoDMI algorithm leads to \"unbiased\" probability of overall survival in LARC patients with Covid-19 infection, compared to that provided by a na\u00efve application of Kaplan-Meier approach.

In parallel, a series of studies showed that, under both homeostatic and pathological conditions, microglia are a heterogeneous cell population. In AD, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaque-associated microglia (PAM) display a clearly distinct phenotype compared to plaque-distant microglia (PCM), suggesting that these two microglia subtypes likely differently contribute to disease progression. So far, molecular characterization of PAM was performed indirectly using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches or based on markers that are supposedly up-regulated in this microglia subpopulation. In this study based on a well-characterized AD mouse model, we combined cell-specific laser capture\u00a0microdissection and RNA-seq analysis to i) identify, without preconceived notions of the molecular and/or functional changes that would affect these cells, the genes and gene networks that are dysregulated in PAM or PCM at three critical stages of the disease, and ii) to investigate the potential contribution of both plaque-associated and plaque-distant microglia. First, we established that our approach allows selective isolation of microglia, while preserving spatial information and preventing transcriptome changes induced by classical purification approaches. Then, we identified, in PAM and PCM subpopulations, networks of co-deregulated genes and analyzed their potential functional roles in AD. Finally, we investigated the dynamics of microglia transcriptomic remodeling at early, intermediate and late stages of the disease\u00a0and validated select findings in postmortem human AD brain. Our comprehensive study provides useful transcriptomic information regarding the respective contribution of PAM and PCM across the A\u03b2 pathology progression. It highlights specific pathways that would require further study to decipher their roles across disease\u00a0progression. It demonstrates that the proximity of microglia to A\u03b2-plaques dramatically alters the microglial transcriptome and reveals that these changes can have both positive and negative impacts on the surrounding cells. These opposing effects may be driven by local microglia heterogeneity also demonstrated by this study. Our approach leads to molecularly define the less well studied plaque-distant microglia. We show that plaque-distant microglia are not bystanders of the disease, although the transcriptomic changes are far less striking compared to what is observed in plaque-associated microglia.

Treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and H2S donors such as sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) can reduce oxidative stress in preclinical studies, however clinical benefits of such treatments are rather ambiguous. This is partly due to poor stability and bioavailability of the H2S donors, requiring impractically large doses that are associated with dose-limiting toxicity. Herein, we identified a bioavailable 3-mercaptopyruvate prodrug, sulfanegen, which is able to pose as a sacrificial redox substrate for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), one of the H2S biosynthetic enzymes in the brain. Sulfanegen is able to mitigate toxicity emanating from oxidative insults and the A\u03b21-42 peptide by releasing H2S through the 3MST pathway. When administered to symptomatic transgenic mouse model of AD (APP/PS1; 7 and 12 months) and mice that were intracerebroventricularly administered with the A\u03b21-42 peptide, sulfanegen was able to reverse oxidative and neuroinflammatory consequences of AD pathology by restoring 3MST function. Quantitative neuropathological analyses confirmed significant disease modifying effect of the compound on amyloid plaque burden and brain inflammatory markers. More importantly, sulfanegen treatment attenuated progressive neurodegeneration in these mice, as evident from the restoration of TH+\u00a0neurons in the locus coeruleus. This study demonstrates a previously unknown concept that supplementation of 3MST function in the brain may be a viable approach for the management of AD. Finally, brought into the spotlight is the potential of sulfanegen as a promising AD therapeutic for future drug development efforts.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36094645": {"ArticleTitle": "Association of Amyloid Reduction After Donanemab Treatment With Tau Pathology and Clinical Outcomes: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.", "AbstractText": "\u03b2-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits biologically define Alzheimer disease. To perform post hoc analyses of amyloid reduction after donanemab treatment and assess its association with tau pathology and clinical measures.

The study was conducted at 56 centers in the US and Canada. Enrolled were participants from 60 to 85 years of age with gradual and progressive change in memory function for 6 months or more, early symptomatic Alzheimer disease, elevated amyloid, and intermediate tau levels. Donanemab (an antibody specific for the N-terminal pyroglutamate \u03b2-amyloid epitope) dosing was every 4 weeks: 700 mg for the first 3 doses, then 1400 mg for up to 72 weeks. Blinded dose-reduction evaluations occurred at 24 and 52 weeks based on amyloid clearance. Change in amyloid, tau, and clinical decline after donanemab treatment. The primary study randomized 272 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [5.5] years; 145 female participants [53.3%]). The trial excluded 1683 of 1955 individuals screened. The rate of donanemab-induced amyloid reduction at 24 weeks was moderately correlated with the amount of baseline amyloid (Spearman correlation coefficient r, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.39; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Modeling provides a hypothesis that amyloid would not reaccumulate to the 24.1-centiloid threshold for 3.9 years (95% prediction interval, 1.9-8.3 years) after discontinuing donanemab treatment. Donanemab slowed tau accumulation in a region-dependent manner as measured using neocortical and regional standardized uptake value ratios with cerebellar gray reference region. A disease-progression model found a significant association between percentage amyloid reduction and change on the integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale only in apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers (95% CI, 24%-59%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Results of post hoc analyses for donanemab-treated participants suggest that baseline amyloid levels were directly associated with the magnitude of amyloid reduction and inversely associated with the probability of achieving complete amyloid clearance. The donanemab-induced slowing of tau was more pronounced in those with complete amyloid clearance and in brain regions identified later in the pathologic sequence.

Immunofluorescence and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) were used to detect the fluorescence intensity of TFEB and the mRNA expression of TFEB and downstream target genes, respectively. The results showed that AM reduced the chemotactic index of transgenic C. elegans CL2241, and decreased the content of A\u03b2 in the supernatant of cell culture medium at different concentrations. In addition, AM lowered the protein level of APP and the fluorescence intensity of APP in a dose-dependent manner.

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of serious games on the cognitive processing speed of an older adult population living with cognitive impairment. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Two search sources were used in this review: 8 electronic databases and backward and forward reference list checking. A total of 2 reviewers independently checked the eligibility of the studies, extracted data from the included studies, and appraised the risk of bias and quality of the evidence. Evidence from the included studies was synthesized using a narrative and statistical approach (ie, meta-analysis), as appropriate. Of the 548 publications identified, 16 (2.9%) RCTs eventually met all eligibility criteria. Very-low-quality evidence from 50% (8/16) and 38% (6/16) of the RCTs showed no statistically significant effect of serious games on processing speed compared with no or passive intervention groups (P=.77) and conventional exercises (P=.58), respectively.

There is no superiority of serious games over no or passive interventions and conventional exercises in improving processing speed among older adults with cognitive impairment. However, our findings remain inconclusive because of the low quality of the evidence, the small sample size in most of the included studies, and the paucity of studies included in the meta-analyses. Therefore, until more robust evidence is published, serious games should be offered or used as an adjunct to existing interventions.

Anionic GSLs, the sialic acid containing gangliosides (GGs), are essential constituents of neuronal cell surfaces, whereas anionic sulfatides are key components of myelin and myelin forming oligodendrocytes. The stepwise biosynthetic pathways of GSLs occur at and lead along the membranes of organellar surfaces of the secretory pathway. After formation of the hydrophobic ceramide membrane anchor of GSLs at the ER, membrane-spanning glycosyltransferases (GTs) of the Golgi and Trans-Golgi network generate cell type-specific GSL patterns for cellular surfaces. GSLs of the cellular plasma membrane can reach intra-lysosomal, i.e. luminal, vesicles (ILVs) by endocytic pathways for degradation. Soluble glycoproteins, the glycosidases, lipid binding and transfer proteins and acid ceramidase are needed for the lysosomal catabolism of GSLs at ILV-membrane surfaces. Inherited mutations triggering a functional loss of glycosylated lysosomal hydrolases and lipid binding proteins involved in GSL degradation cause a primary lysosomal accumulation of their non-degradable GSL substrates in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Lipid binding proteins, the SAPs, and the various lipids of the ILV-membranes regulate GSL catabolism, but also primary storage compounds such as sphingomyelin (SM), cholesterol (Chol.), or chondroitin sulfate can effectively inhibit catabolic lysosomal pathways of GSLs. This causes cascades of metabolic errors, accumulating secondary lysosomal GSL- and GG- storage that can trigger a complex pathology (Breiden and Sandhoff, Int J Mol Sci 21(7):2566, 2020).", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36197131": {"ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer disease and the evolving treatment landscape.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that destroys memory and the ability to think, slowly over time. AD is the leading type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of cases, and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. AD, which can range from mild to severe, is thought to occur secondary to the aggregation and accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptides, abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein, and neuroinflammation. Current treatment options vary depending on the severity of AD, and emerging treatment options continue to arise. Managed care organizations are in an excellent position to implement viable patient care ecosystems to support patients and caregivers in decreasing AD progression and its consequences.

Although NRF2/NFE2L2 pathway activation commonly occurs in LUSC, NRF2 has predominantly been studied in other cancer models. Here, we investigated the function of NRF2 in LUSC, including in organoid models, and we explored the activity of a small molecule NRF2 inhibitor ML385, which has not previously been investigated in LUSC. We first explored the role of NRF2 signaling in LUSC cancer cell line and organoid proliferation through NRF2 knockdown or ML385 treatment, both in vivo and in vitro. Next, we performed Western blot and immunofluorescence assays to determine the effect of NRF2 inhibition on PI3K-mTOR signaling. Finally, we used cell viability and clonogenic assays to explore whether ML385 could sensitize LUSC cancer cells to PI3K inhibitors. We find that downregulation of NRF2 signaling inhibited proliferation of LUSC cancer cell lines and organoids, both in vivo and in vitro. We also demonstrate that inhibition of NRF2 reduces PI3K-mTOR signaling, with two potential mechanisms being involved. Although NRF2 promotes AKT phosphorylation, it also acts downstream of AKT to increase RagD protein expression and recruitment of mTOR to lysosomes after amino acid stimulation. We also find that ML385 potentiates LUSC growth inhibition by a pan-PI3K inhibitor, which correlates with stronger inhibition of PI3K-mTOR signaling. Our data provide additional support for NRF2 promoting LUSC growth through PI3K-mTOR activation and support development of NRF2 inhibitors for the treatment of LUSC.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36308442": {"ArticleTitle": "Evaluating the relevance of surgical margins. Part one: The problems with current methodology.", "AbstractText": "The goal of cancer surgery is to achieve a \"clean\" microscopic resection, with no residual tumour remaining in the wound. To achieve that goal, the surgeon typically incorporates a measured buffer of grossly normal tissue about the entire circumference of the tumour. Microscopic analysis of the resection boundaries is then performed to determine if all traces of the tumour have been completely removed. This analysis is thought to provide a surrogate indication as to the likelihood for that tumour to recur after surgery. However, it is recognised that tumour recurrence may not occur even when microscopic evidence of tumour has been identified at the resection margins, and recurrence can also occur when conventional histology has considered the tumour to have been completely removed. The explanations for this dichotomy are numerous and include technical and practical limitations of the processing methodology, and also several surgeon-related and tumour-related reasons. Ultimately, the inability to confidently determine when a tumour has been removed sufficiently to prevent recurrence can impact on the ability to provide owners with confident treatment advice. In this article, the authors describe the challenges with defining the true extent of the tumour margin from the perspective of the surgeon, the pathologist and the tumour. The authors also provide an analysis of why our current efforts to ensure that all traces of the local tumour have been successfully removed may provide an imperfect assessment of the risk of recurrence.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36303724": {"ArticleTitle": "Differential Interactome Based Drug Repositioning Unraveled Abacavir, Exemestane, Nortriptyline Hydrochloride, and Tolcapone as Potential Therapeutics for Colorectal Cancers.", "AbstractText": "There is a critical requirement for alternative strategies to provide the better treatment in colorectal cancer (CRC).

A case study exploring the lived experiences of a family of a person with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia.", "AbstractText": "The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia is characterized by profound changes in personality and behavior that often start before the age of 65\u00a0years. These symptoms impact family life, particularly if (adult) children live at home. In research on young-onset dementia or frontotemporal dementia, the family itself is hardly ever a unit of analysis. Insight in the perspectives of different family members from the same household helps to obtain a deeper understanding of the complex impact of the symptoms on family dynamics. This case study explored the perspectives of one family having a relative with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia living at home. Over the course of 4\u00a0months, different family members were individually interviewed twice. Two authors independently performed a directed content analysis. The family consisted of a father, mother, and three adult children. Around 3\u00a0years before the interviews the father was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.The main category identified was the change in family dynamics over the disease trajectory. Three subcategories characterized the changing family dynamics, namely (a) the change in existing roles, relationships and interaction patterns in the family due to early symptoms, (b) a redefinition of roles and responsibility in the family once the diagnosis was established, and (c) the formation of new roles, relationships and interaction patterns in the family by organizing post-diagnostic support at home. Symptoms of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia have a complex and profound impact on family dynamics and change existing roles, relationships, and interaction patterns. Psychosocial support may help families by accounting for individual differences in involvement, coping, and bereavement. This may help to create a sense of mutual understanding between family members that could potentially strengthen their relationship. This may help families to deal with the difficult challenge of organizing care for a relative with frontotemporal dementia who lives at home.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36165202": {"ArticleTitle": "Transcriptomic Profiling Identifies CD8+ T Cells in the Brain of Aged and Alzheimer's Disease Transgenic Mice as Tissue-Resident Memory T Cells.", "AbstractText": "Peripheral immune cell infiltration into the brain is a prominent feature in aging and various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). As AD progresses, CD8+ T cells infiltrate into the brain parenchyma, where they tightly associate with neurons and microglia. The functional properties of CD8+ T cells in the brain are largely unknown. To gain further insights into the putative functions of CD8+ T cells in the brain, we explored and compared the transcriptomic profile of CD8+ T cells isolated from the brain and blood of transgenic AD (APPswe/PSEN1dE9, line 85 [APP-PS1]) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Brain CD8+ T cells of APP-PS1 and WT animals had similar transcriptomic profiles and substantially differed from blood circulating CD8+ T cells. The gene signature of brain CD8+ T cells identified them as tissue-resident memory (Trm) T cells. Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis on the significantly upregulated genes revealed overrepresentation of biological processes involved in IFN-\u03b2 signaling and the response to viral infections. Furthermore, brain CD8+ T cells of APP-PS1 and aged WT mice showed similar differentially regulated genes as brain Trm CD8+ T cells in mouse models with acute virus infection, chronic parasite infection, and tumor growth.

The tau-mediated disease mechanisms that drive neurodegenerative disease are still unknown. Tau interactome studies are critically important for understanding tauopathy. They reveal the interacting partners that define disease pathways, and the tau interactions present in neuropathological aggregates provide potential insight into the cellular environment and protein interactions present during pathological tau aggregation. Here we provide a combined analysis of 12 tau interactome studies of human brain tissue, human cell culture models and rodent models of disease. Together, these studies identified 2084 proteins that interact with tau in human tissue and 1152 proteins that interact with tau in rodent models of disease. Our combined analysis of the tau interactome revealed consistent enrichment of interactions between tau and proteins involved in RNA binding, ribosome, and proteasome function. Comparison of human and rodent tau interactome studies revealed substantial differences between the two species. We also performed a second analysis to identify the tau interacting proteins that are enriched in neurons containing granulovacuolar degeneration or neurofibrillary tangle pathology. These results revealed a timed dysregulation of tau interactions as pathology develops.

HSV-1 antibodies were assayed in baseline sera collected from 2009-2015. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare outcomes by HSV-1 seropositivity and high HSV-1 IgG titres/IgM status. There was no association between baseline HSV-1 seropositivity and rates of cognitive decline or whole brain atrophy. Having high HSV-1 IgG titres/IgM was associated with a slightly greater decline in MMSE points per year (difference in slope\u2009-\u20090.365, 95% CI: -0.958 to -0.072), but not with rate of whole brain atrophy. Symptomatic mutation carriers declined fastest on both MMSE and BSI measures, however, this was not influenced by HSV-1. Among asymptomatic mutation carriers, rates of decline on MMSE and BSI were slightly greater among those who were HSV-1 seronegative.

This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in HCC and their impact on tumor immune function, thereby providing new insights into targeted therapy for HCC. First, 43 differentially expressed FRGs were identified using the TCGA database, and four prognostically relevant methylation-driven FRGs (G6PD, HELLS, RRM2, and STMN1) were screened via survival and methylation analyses. Gene co-expression, mutation, and clinicopathological characterization indicated that these four pivotal FRGs play essential roles in tumor progression. We also validated these four genes using transcriptomic and proteomic data as well as cohort samples from our patients. Moreover, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that the signatures of the four FRGs were independent prognostic factors in HCC. Gene set enrichment analysis of the four FRGs showed statistically significant associations with pathways related to HCC proliferation. Finally, the TIMER and TISIDB databases indicated that the four FRGs were statistically significantly correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells and immune checkpoint expression.

Cancer burden was measured by cancer-related deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs). In 2019, age-standardized rates of death, DALYs and YLLs among the cancer population globally caused by secondhand smoke were 1.60, 38.54 and 37.77, respectively. The proportions of these in the total cancer burden for all risk factors combined decreased slightly from 1990 to 2003 and then increased from 2004 to 2019. In 2019, >50% of the cancer burden was concentrated in men aged 55-75 years and women aged 50-70 years. Between 1990 and 2019, there was an increase in age-standardized rates of death, DALYs, YLDs and YLLs among those aged \u226570 years. The age-standardized YLDs rate attributable to secondhand smoke was higher among women; it decreased in men but increased in women, causing a wider gap between the sexes. A greater cancer burden was mainly seen in North America in 1990 and Europe in 2019. Reductions in the annual rate change of cancer burden were found mainly in North America and Oceania, while increases were found in Africa and Asia. In 2019, high-middle- and middle-SDI countries had higher age-standardized rates of deaths, DALYs, YLDs and YLLs than the global level. During 1990 and 2019, the largest decline in cancer burden was seen in high-SDI countries, while middle- or low-SDI countries experienced increases in all age-standardized rates.

However, the majority class can be under-weighted by them, due to the existence of data overlap. Besides, they are more mis-calibrated. To resolve these, we propose a neural network with prior-shift regularization (PSR-Net), which comprises a UNet-like backbone with re-weighting loss functions, and a prior-shift regularization (PSR) module including a prior-shift layer (PSL), a regularizer generation layer (RGL), and an expected prediction confidence updating layer (EPCUL). We first propose a trainable expected prediction confidence (EPC) for each class. Periodically, PSL shifts a prior training dataset to a more informative dataset based on EPCs; RGL presents a generalized informative-voxel-aware (GIVA) loss with EPCs and calculates it on the informative dataset for model finetuning in back-propagation; and EPCUL updates EPCs to refresh PSL and RRL in next forward-propagation. PSR-Net is trained in a two- stage manner. The backbone is first trained with re-weighting loss functions, then we reload the best saved model for the backbone and continue to train it with the weighted sum of the re-weighting loss functions, the GIVA regularizer and the L2 loss function of EPCs for regularization fine-tuning.

In addition to not yielding effective treatments, the phenotypically heterogeneous biological processes that have been the primary area of focus to date have not been adequately shown to be necessary or sufficient to explain the risk and progression of AD.

In the absence of adequate cognitive stimulus, physiological demand-function coupling leads to downregulation of growth, repair, and homeostatic processes, resulting in deteriorating brain tissue health, function, and capacity.

Correlations between outcome events and variables were analyzed using univariate and multifactorial Cox regression, and variables screened by the multifactorial Cox risk proportional model were used to construct a survival prediction model. The model was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and C-index and calibration curves. Univariate and multifactorial COX analyses revealed five independent prognostic factors for parathyroid carcinoma patients, which were subsequently used to develop the nomogram prediction model. In the training cohort, the C-index of the nomogram in predicting the overall survival (OS) was 0.747 (0.686-0.808), the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve(AUC)values of the nomogram in prediction of the 3, 5, and 10-year OS were 0.718 (0617-0.819), 0.711 (0.614-0.808) and 0.706 (0.610-0.803), respectively.

Moreover, these measurements were assayed in the most effective extract after incorporating Au-NPs. The study revealed that total methanolic extract exhibited the highest biological and cytotoxic activities as compared to other fractions. Therefore, it is considered as good candidate for nano-extract preparation. The methanolic extract incorporated with Au-NPs showed higher antioxidant, scavenging and cytotoxic activities in addition to higher inhibitory effect against \u03b1-amylase activity as compared to native extract itself. To pinpoint active agents in total methanolic extract, the secondary metabolite profiling via HPLC-MS showed that 33 and 17 metabolites were annotated in the extract before and after incorporating Au-NPs, respectively. The median lethal dose (LD50) showed that gold total methanolic nano-extract is safer than total methanolic extract. This study concluded that total methanolic C. equisetifolia bark extract is a valuable bioresource to synthesize an eco-friendly Au-NPs with health-enhancing effect as antioxidant, antidiabetic and cytotoxic agents.

Many studies have been performed on the potential mechanisms behind RR, and a strong link has been found between RR and DNA damage. RT-induced DNA damage triggers a protective mechanism called the DNA damage response (DDR). DDR consists of several aspects, including the detection of DNA damage and induction of cell cycle checkpoint, DNA repair, and eventual induction of cell death. A large number of studies have shown that DDR inhibition leads to significantly enhanced sensitivity of cancer cells to RT. DDR may be an effective target for radio- and chemo-sensitization during cancer treatment. Therefore, many inhibitors of important enzymes involved in the DDR have been developed, such as PARP inhibitors, DNA-PK inhibitors, and ATM/ATR inhibitors. In addition, DNA damage also triggers the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and the ATM/ATR(CHK)/STAT pathway to induce immune infiltration and T-cell activation. This review discusses the effects of DDR pathway dysregulation on the tumor response to RT and the strategies for targeting these pathways to increase tumor susceptibility to RT.

The best cellular correlates of the early cognitive deficits in AD patients are synapse loss and gliosis. In particular, it is unclear whether the activation of microglia (microgliosis) has a neuroprotective or pathological role early in AD. Here we report that microgliosis is an early mediator of synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of increased amyloidosis. We found that the appearance of microgliosis, synaptic dysfunction and behavioral impairment coincided with increased soluble A\u03b242 levels, and occurred well before the presence of A\u03b2 plaques. Inhibition of microglial activity by treatment with minocycline (MC) reduced gliosis, synaptic deficits and cognitive impairments at early pathological stages and was most effective when provided preventive, i.e., before the onset of microgliosis. Interestingly, soluble A\u03b2 levels or A\u03b2 plaques deposition were not affected by preventive MC treatment at an early pathological stage (4\u00a0months) whereas these were reduced upon treatment at a later stage (6\u00a0months).

High Ets1 expression is often associated with colorectal tumorigenesis.

The interaction domains are further addressed to be the segment at Sp1(626-708) and the segment at Ets1(244-331). In addition, the phosphorylation inhibition of Ets1 at Tyr283 by either downregulation of Src kinase or Src family inhibitor treatment decreases the interaction between Sp1 and Ets1 and suppresses SW480 migration. Either administration or overexpression of the peptides harboring the interaction segment strongly inhibits the colony formation and migration of SW480 cells.

Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Memory and Executive Screening Scale (MES), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Digital Span Test (DST) and Verbal Fluency Task (VFT), respectively. DST included Forward Digit Span Test (FDST) and Backward Digit Span Test (BDST). All the subjects underwent 3.0T coronal three-dimensional gradient echo sequence MRI. MTA scale was performed to evaluate the degree of medial temporal lobe atrophy. The differences in the sarcopenia-related indicators, cognitive score and MTA score were analyzed among the three groups, and the partial correlation analysis was performed between the inter-groups. Results: Eighty AD patients (24 males and 56 females) were included, aged (72\u00b17) years old, with 41 mild and 39 moderate patients. Meanwhile, 43 NC included 19 males and 24 females, with a mean age of (70\u00b16) years old. The disease duration in moderate AD patients was longer than that of mild AD patients [34.0 (25.0, 43.5) months vs 24.0 (11.0, 34.0) months, P<0.001]. The differences of sarcopenia-related indicators and MTA score among the three groups were statistically significant (all P<0.001), including 5-times sit-to-stand time [(13.6\u00b11.8) s vs (11.5\u00b11.7) s vs (10.3\u00b11.9) s, P<0.001] and MTA score [2.0 (2.0, 3.0) vs 1.0 (1.0, 2.0) vs 0 (0, 0), P<0.001]. In neuropsychological tests, compared to the NC group, MMSE, MoCA, MES and VFT scores in mild and moderate AD groups were lower (all P<0.001); meanwhile, compared to the mild AD group, the moderate group had lower MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST and VFT scores (all P<0.001). In sarcopenia-related indicators, muscle strength in particular was correlated with widespread cognitive functioning domains and MTA score in AD patients. Grip strength was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA , MES, FDST (r=0.387, 0.418, 0.522 and 0.484, respectively, all P<0.001), DSST (r=0.327, P=0.006) and VFT score (r=0.354, P=0.003), and negatively correlated with MTA score (r=-0.631, P<0.001). 5-times sit-to-stand time was negatively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST, VFT score (r=-0.583, -0.587, -0.814, -0.591, -0.552 and -0.485, respectively, all P<0.001), and BDST (r=-0.355, P=0.003) strongly positively correlated with MTA score (r=0.836, P<0.001). ASMI was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST score (r=0.257, 0.238, 0.428, 0.282 and 0.364, respectively, all P<0.05), and negatively correlated with MTA score (r=-0.377, P=0.001). 6-m gait speed was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST score (r=0.419, 0.486, 0.699, 0.559 and 0.500, respectively, all P<0.001), BDST and VFT score (r=0.384\u30010.377, respectively, both P=0.001), and strongly negatively correlated with MTA score (r=-0.803, P<0.001). Conclusions: Patients with mild to moderate AD have widespread cognitive impairment. Muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function are all significantly impaired. Compared to muscle mass and physical function, decreased muscle strength is significantly associated with widespread cognitive decline and increased degree of medial temporal lobe atrophy.

(stray) represent the largest heterogeneous cat population subject to natural selection, while populations of the Siamese (SIAM) and Oriental Shorthair (OSH) breeds developed through intensive artificial selection for aesthetic traits. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) and demographic measures are useful tools to discover chromosomal regions of recent selection and to characterize genetic diversity in domestic cat populations. To achieve this, we genotyped 150 stray and 26 household non-breeding cats (household) on the Illumina feline 63\u00a0K SNP BeadChip and compared them to SIAM and OSH. The 50% decay value of squared correlation coefficients (r2) in stray (0.23), household (0.25), OSH (0.24) and SIAM (0.25) corresponded to a mean marker distance of 1.12\u00a0Kb, 4.55\u00a0Kb, 62.50\u00a0Kb and 175.07\u00a0Kb, respectively. The effective population size (Ne) decreased in the current generation to 55 in stray, 11 in household, 9 in OSH and 7 in SIAM. In the recent generation, the increase in inbreeding per generation (\u0394F) reached its maximum values of 0.0090, 0.0443, 0.0561 and 0.0710 in stray, household, OSH and SIAM, respectively. The genomic inbreeding coefficient (FROH) based on ROH was calculated for three length categories. The FROH was between 0.014 (FROH60) and 0.020 (FROH5) for stray, between 0.018 (FROH60) and 0.024 (FROH5) for household, between 0.048 (FROH60) and 0.069 (FROH5) for OSH and between 0.053 (FROH60) and 0.073 (FROH5) for SIAM. We identified nine unique selective regions for stray through genome-wide analyses for regions with reduced heterozygosity based on FST statistics. Genes in these regions have previously been associated with reproduction (BUB1B), motor/neurological behavior (GPHN, GABRB3), cold-induced thermogenesis (DIO2, TSHR), immune system development (TSHR), viral carcinogenesis (GTF2A1), host immune response against bacteria, viruses, chemoattractant and cancer cells (PLCB2, BAHD1, TIGAR), and lifespan and aging (BUB1B, FGF23). In addition, we identified twelve unique selective regions for OSH containing candidate genes for a wide range of coat colors and patterns (ADAMTS20, KITLG, TYR, TYRO3-a MITF regulator, GPNMB, FGF7, RAB38) as well as congenital heart defects (PDE4D, PKP2) and gastrointestinal disorders (NLGN1, ALDH1B1). Genes in stray that represent unique selective events indicate, at least in part, natural selection for environmental adaptation and resistance to infectious disease, and should be the subject of future research. Stray cats represent an important genetic resource and have the potential to become a research model for disease resistance and longevity, which is why we recommend preserving semen before neutering.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36303307": {"ArticleTitle": "Population Prevalence, Cancer Risk, and Mortality Risk of Turner Syndrome in South Korean Women Based on National Health Insurance Service Data.", "AbstractText": "In South Korea, investigations into Turner syndrome (TS) prevalence and TS-associated cancer and mortality are lacking.

To estimate TS-associated cancer and mortality risk, the data were compared with data of 1:3 age-matched controls. In 2017, 2054 patients with TS were identified from a total population of 26186952 South Korean women; therefore, the prevalence was 7.84 per 100000 persons.

The purpose was to evaluate the general (across tests/domains) and domain-specific PE calculated as the annual rate of change (ARC) in relation to years to the estimated disease onset (YECO) and in four groups of AD: asymptomatic mutation carriers (aAD, n = 19), prodromal, i.e., symptomatic mutation carriers, criteria for AD diagnosis not fulfilled (pAD, n = 4) and mutation carriers diagnosed with AD (dAD, n = 6) as well as mutation non-carriers from the AD families serving as a healthy comparison group (HC, n = 35). Cognition was assessed at baseline and follow-up about 3 years later by 12 tests covering six domains. The aAD and HC groups were comparable at baseline in demographic characteristics (age, gender, and education), when they were in their early forties, while the pAD and dAD groups were older and cognitively impaired. The results on mean ARC for the four groups were significantly different, small, positive, and age-insensitive in the HC group, while ARC was negative and declined with time/disease advancement in AD. The differences between HC and aAD groups in mean ARC and domain-specific ARC were not significant, indicating a subtle PE in aAD in the early preclinical stage of AD. In the symptomatic stages of AD, there was no PE probably due to cognitive disease-related progression. PEs were the largest in the verbal domain in both the HC and aAD groups, indicating a relationship with cognitive vulnerability. The group-related difference in mean ARC was predominant in timekeeping tests.

However, the causality has been based on the presence of the virus, or its genetic material, in the sampled tumours. We have long wondered if viruses cause cancer via a \"hit and run\" mechanism such that they are no longer present in the resulting tumours. Here, we hypothesise that the absence of viral genes from the tumour does not necessarily exclude the viral aetiology. To test this, we used an HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) tumour model and CRISPR to delete the viral oncogene, E7. Indeed, the genetic removal of HPV E7 oncogene eliminates tumours in vivo. Remarkably, E7 deleted tumours recurred overtime and develop new mutations not previously seen in HPV+ OPC tumours. Importantly, a number of these new mutations are found to be already present in HPV- OPC tumours. This article is protected by copyright.

There is no established first-line treatment, and prognosis is poor compared to conventional breast cancer. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of cisplatinum and eribulin in a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse model of primary breast osteosarcoma. However, these drugs show significant clinical toxicity. All cancers are addicted to methionine (Hoffman effect). In the present study, we determined whether methionine restriction with oral recombinant methioninase (o-rMETase) would lower the effective dose of cisplatinum in a PDOX model of primary osteosarcoma of the mammary gland, thereby reducing its toxicity. Mouse PDOX models of primary osteosarcoma of the breast were randomized into the following groups: control; cisplatinum (weekly at 3 or 6 mg/kg); twice-daily o-rMETase; or o-rMETase combined with 3 mg/kg cisplatinum, with treatment for 2 weeks. Cisplatinum at 6 mg/kg significantly inhibited breast osteosarcoma growth compared with the untreated control and mice treated with 3 mg/kg cisplatinum (p=0.01 and 0.009, respectively). There was no significant difference in tumor growth between mice treated with cisplatinum at 3 mg/kg and the control (p=0.16). Combination therapy with cisplatinum at 3 mg/kg and twice daily o-rMETase regressed the osteosarcoma of the mammary gland (p=0.009), similar to the inhibition by cisplatinum at 6 mg/kg alone. Cisplatinum at 6 mg/kg caused a significant loss of mouse body weight, compared to the control (p=0.02). There was no significant body-weight loss with the combination therapy of o-rMETase and cisplatinum at 3 mg/kg, compared to the untreated control. o-rMETase halved the effective dose of cisplatinum, thereby eliminating cisplatinum toxicity, demonstrating a future clinical strategy for therapy of osteosarcoma of the breast.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36308381": {"ArticleTitle": "Identification of Malignancy in PAP Smear Samples Using the CGB3 and NOP56 Genes as Methylation Markers.", "AbstractText": "Although various improvements have been made in the reporting of the Papanicolaou (PAP) test in recent years, there remain several challenges that have yet to be addressed in terms of determining a standardized methodology for categorizing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC US).

One pathological hallmark of T2D is the toxic accumulation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregates. Monomeric hIAPP is a hormone normally co-secreted with insulin. However, increased levels of hIAPP in prediabetic and diabetic patients can lead to the formation of hIAPP protofibrils, which are toxic to \u03b2 cells. Current therapies fail to address hIAPP aggregation and current screening modalities do not detect it. Using a stabilizing capping protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be developed against a previously nonisolatable form of hIAPP protofibrils, which are protofibril specific and do not engage monomeric hIAPP. Shown here are two candidate mAbs that can detect hIAPP protofibrils in serum and hIAPP deposits in pancreatic islets in a mouse model of rapidly progressing T2D. Treatment of diabetic mice with the mAbs delays disease progression and dramatically increases overall survival. These results demonstrate the potential for using novel hIAPP protofibril-specific mAbs as a diagnostic screening tool for early detection of T2D, as well as therapeutically to preserve \u03b2 cell function and target one of the underlying pathological mechanisms of T2D.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36242017": {"ArticleTitle": "Reading activities compensate for low education-related cognitive deficits.", "AbstractText": "The incidence of cognitive impairment is increasing with an aging population.

Participants in the reading group had better performance in all cognitive tests compared with those in the non-reading group, but no difference in brain MRI variables. Participants with higher education levels (more than 13 years) had better cognitive performance and higher hippocampal volumes. In low education groups (less than 12 years), more reading activities were associated with better cognitive test scores. Both education and reading activities are important and synergistic for baseline cognitive function. Higher education level is associated with larger hippocampal volumes.

Semi-quantitative imaging changes (visual rating scale grading) suggestive of SVD were analyzed singularly and compositely, and their correlations with cognitive domains and AD subtypes were examined.

Here, the VLM is applied to Japanese mtDNA sequences; in doing so, we explored the role of mtDNA variation in AD and ageing in a different global population. Consistent with the previous findings using the VLM in two populations of European origin, we found no evidence for an association between rarer, non-haplogroup associated variation and the development of AD.

In contrast to our previous study, our present results suggest that those living to advanced old age may harbour more mildly deleterious mtDNA variations.

Over 18 years follow-up, we extended the family with 10 p.R406W carriers and provided an in-depth clinical description of the patients. Additionally, genetic screening was used to identify p.R406W carriers in Belgian cohorts of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease patients and to calculate p.R406W frequency. In the frontotemporal dementia cohort, we found four p.R406W carriers (n\u2009=\u2009647,0.62%) and three in the Alzheimer's disease cohort (n\u2009=\u20091134, 0.26%). Haplotype sharing analysis showed evidence of a shared haplotype suggesting that they are descendants of a common ancestor.

Intriguingly, the phenotypic spectrum among the p.R406W patients ranged from typical behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia to clinical Alzheimer's disease, based on CSF biomarker analysis and amyloid PET scan. Heterogeneous overlap syndromes existed in between, with highly common neuropsychiatric symptoms like disinhibition and aggressiveness, which occurred in 100% of frontotemporal dementia and 58% of clinical Alzheimer's disease patients. This was also the case for memory problems, 89% in frontotemporal dementia and 100% in clinical Alzheimer's disease patients. Median age at death was significantly lower in patients with frontotemporal dementia (68 years) compared to clinical Alzheimer's disease patients (79 years), though the sizes of the sub-cohorts are limited and do not allow prognostic predictions.

Tauopathy can impair cognitive and motor functions and has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The aetiology of tauopathy remains mysterious; however, recent studies suggest that the autophagic-endolysosomal function plays an essential role in the degradation and transmission of pathological tau. We previously demonstrated that tetrandrine could ameliorate memory functions and clear amyloid plaques in transgenic AD mice by restoring autophagic-endolysosomal function. However, the efficacy of tetrandrine and the associated therapeutic mechanism in tauopathies have not been evaluated and elucidated. Novel object recognition, fear conditioning and electrophysiology were used to evaluate the effects of tetrandrine on memory functions in transgenic tau mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the effect of tetrandrine on autophagy and tau clearance in vivo. Calcium (Ca2+) imaging and flow cytometry were used to delineate the role of pathological tau and tetrandrine in lysosomal Ca2+ and pH homeostasis. Biochemical BiFC fluorescence, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas coculture of brain slices with isolated microglia was used to evaluate tau clearance ex vivo. We observed that tetrandrine treatment mitigated tau tangle development and corrected memory impairment in Thy1-hTau.P301S transgenic mice. Mechanistically, we showed that mutant tau expression disrupts lysosome pH by increasing two-pore channel 2 (TPC2)-mediated Ca2+ release, thereby contributing to lysosome alkalinization. Tetrandrine inhibits TPC2, thereby restoring the lysosomal pH, promotes tau degradation via autophagy, and ameliorates tau aggregation. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, we demonstrated that tetrandrine treatment promotes pathological tau clearance by microglia. Together, these findings suggest that pathological tau disturbs endolysosomal homeostasis to impair tau clearance. This impairment results in a vicious cycle that accelerates disease pathogenesis.

The presence of adiponectin and its receptor in the brain with its unique anti-diabetic effects and association with neurodegenerative diseases has raised our interest in exploring orally active small molecule adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon. To date, all the available drugs for the treatment of AD provides symptomatic relief and do not stall the progression of the disease. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent to find appropriate targets. Here, we attempt to shed lights on adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon and its downstream molecular targets in reducing disease pathogenesis and insulin resistance. In brain, AdipoRon induced AMPK activation, increased insulin sensitivity, reduced amyloid beta plaque deposition and improved cognitive impairment. Levels of BACE were also downregulated while LDLR, APOE and neprilysin were upregulated promoting amyloid beta clearance from brain. AdipoRon further reduced the chronic inflammatory marker, GFAP and improved synaptic markers PSD-95 and synaptophysin in APP/PS1 mice. Our in-vitro studies further confirmed the potential role of AdipoRon in improving insulin sensitivity by increasing GLUT 4 translocation, glucose uptake and insulin signaling under hyperinsulinemic condition.

RB was tested in vitro (0.3-1\u00a0\u03bcM) and prevented A\u03b2 oligomers-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in PC12 cells. Moreover, RB (10-30\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) effectively attenuated cognitive impairments induced by A\u03b2 oligomers in mice. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that RB significantly increased the expression of pSer473-Akt, pSer9-glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and reduced the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) both in vitro and in vivo.

However, the treatment results remain unsatisfactory due to the lack of a safe and efficient nonviral gene vector. To tackle this hurdle, biodegradable and CO2 -derivative cationic poly(vinylcyclohexene carbonates) (CPCHCs) has been used as gene vectors to perform a siPLK1 therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma treatment. Of those CPCHCs, CPCHC60 has demonstrated the most excellent performance in gene transfection efficiency, endo-lysosome escaping, biodegradability and biosafety.

Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.The proposed harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology, determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and vascular disease.We provide a framework for current and future studies to be carried out within the Consortium. and offers a \"green paper\" to the research community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low- and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data on the topic.The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19 neuropsychiatric sequelae. We expect that deep phenotyping of neuropsychiatric sequelae may provide a series of candidate syndromes with phenomenological and biological characterization that can be further explored.

A review and empirical assessment of clinical case reports and published artworks for systematic evidence of quality and style changes linked to damage or neurodegenerative disease.", "AbstractText": "The past three decades have seen multiple reports of people with neurodegenerative disorders, or other forms of changes in their brains, who also show putative changes in how they approach and produce visual art. Authors argue that these cases may provide a unique body of evidence, so-called 'artistic signatures' of neurodegenerative diseases, that might be used to understand disorders, provide diagnoses, be employed in treatment, create patterns of testable hypotheses for causative study, and also provide unique insight into the neurobiological linkages between the mind, brain, body, and the human penchant for art-making itself. However-before we can begin to meaningfully build from such emerging findings, much less formulate applications-not only is such evidence currently quite disparate and in need of systematic review, almost all case reports and artwork ratings are entirely subjective, based on authors' personal observations or a sparse collection of methods that may not best fit underlying research aims. This leads to the very real question of whether we might actually find patterns of systematic change if fit to a rigorous review-Can we really 'read' art to illuminate possible changes in the brain? How might we best approach this topic in future neuroscientific, clinical, and art-related research? This paper presents a review of this field and answer to these questions. We consider the current case reports for seven main disorders-Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia, corticobasal degeneration, aphasia, as well as stroke-consolidating arguments for factors and changes related to art-making and critiquing past methods. Taking the published artworks from these papers, we then conduct our own assessment, employing computerized and human-rater-based approaches, which we argue represent best practice to identify stylistic or creativity/quality changes. We suggest, indeed, some evidence for systematic patterns in art-making for specific disorders and also find that case authors showed rather high agreement with our own assessments. More important, through opening this topic and past evidence to a systematic review, we hope to open a discussion and provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for future application and research on the intersection of art-making and the neurotypical, the changed, and the artistic brain.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36281664": {"ArticleTitle": "Effectiveness of Physical Exercise on Alzheimer's disease.

Publications investigating the effect of any type of physical exercise-based intervention in any of its multiple modalities on physical-functional capacity, cognitive performance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life were searched. The data were extracted into predesigned data extraction tables. Risk of bias was evaluated through the PEDro scale and its internal validity scale. A total of 8 different randomized controlled trials with a total sample of 562 non-overlap Alzheimer disease patients between 50-90 years and a mean age of 75.2 \u00b1 3.9 years were eligible for analyses. Physical-functional capacity was evaluated in 6 of 8 studies and cognitive performance was evaluated in 5 of 8 studies, all of them showed improvements in these variables when compared with the controls, except for two studies in physical-functional capacity and one study for cognitive performance. In the physical-functional capacity and cognitive performance variables, aerobic physical exercise was used in isolation, or in a multimodal way, combining aerobic, strength and balance exercise, from 2 to 7 weekly sessions with doses between 30 and 90 minutes, and a duration of the program comprised of 9 weeks to 6 months. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life were evaluated in 2 of 8 studies, which the intervention groups experienced significant improvements when compared with the control groups, except for one study that found similar differences in quality of life between both groups. In the neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life variables, only aerobic physical exercise was used, in a more homogeneous way, from 2 to 3 weekly sessions with doses of 30 to 60 minutes, and a total program duration of 9 to 16 weeks. Despite the scarcity of studies, especially those based on multimodal proposals, and the heterogeneity in the protocols, this systematic review found moderate to limited evidence that aerobic physical exercise on its own or combined in a multimodal program that also includes strength and balance exercise can be a useful tool in the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease with the aim of maintaining and/or improving physical-functional capacity and cognitive performance.

Consequently, microarrays, which capture gene expression genome-wide, have been used widely over the past two decades to derive biomarker signatures for tasks such as cancer grading, prognosticating the formation of metastases, survival, and others. Each of these signatures was selected and optimized for a very specific phenotype, tissue type, and experimental set-up. While all of these differences may naturally contribute to very heterogeneous and different biomarker signatures, all cancers share characteristics regardless of particular cell types or tissue as summarized in the hallmarks of cancer. These commonalities could give rise to biomarker signatures, which perform well across different phenotypes, cell and tissue types. Here, we explore this possibility by employing a network-based approach for pan-cancer biomarker discovery. We implement a random surfer model, which integrates interaction, expression, and phenotypic information to rank genes by their suitability for outcome prediction. To evaluate our approach, we assembled 105 high-quality microarray datasets sampled from around 13,000 patients and covering 13 cancer types. We applied our approach (NetRank) to each dataset and aggregated individual signatures into one compact signature of 50 genes. This signature stands out for two reasons. First, in contrast to other signatures of the 105 datasets, it is performant across nearly all cancer types and phenotypes. Second, It is interpretable, as the majority of genes are linked to the hallmarks of cancer in general and proliferation specifically. Many of the identified genes are cancer drivers with a known mutation burden linked to cancer. Overall, our work demonstrates the power of network-based approaches to compose robust, compact, and universal biomarker signatures for cancer outcome prediction.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36308667": {"ArticleTitle": "The Paradoxical Home and Body in Jennifer Johnston's The Christmas Tree (1981).", "AbstractText": "Jennifer Johnston's fiction presents the conditions of Irish culture and society by exploring the separations between interior and exterior realms and past and present temporalities persisting within the insulating privacy of the familial home space.

In this study, we developed a novel cancer cell separation chip, \"hybrid double-spiral chip\", that involves the serial combination of two different Dean flow fractionation (DFF) separation modes of half and full Dean cycles, which is the hybrid DFF separation mode for ultra-high-throughput blood processing at high precision and size-resolution separation.

The average recovery rate of spiked A549 cancer cells was 87% with as low as 200 cells in 5 mL blood. The device can achieve serial reduction in the number of cells from approximately 1010 cells of whole blood to 108 cells, and subsequently to an order of 106 cells. The developed method can be combined with measurements of all recovered cells using imaging flow cytometry.

It is possible to employ reliable biomarkers to diagnose cancer in the early stages, predict the patient prognosis, follow up the response to treatment, and estimate the risk of disease recurrence with high sensitivity and specificity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosomes, have been the focus of translational research to develop such biomarkers over the past decade. The abundance and distribution of exosomes in bodily fluids, including serum, saliva, and urine, as well as their ability to transport various biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids) derived from their parent cells, make exosomes reliable, accessible, and potent biomarkers for diagnosis and follow-up of solid and hematopoietic tumors. In addition, exosomes play a vital role in various cellular processes, including tumor progression, by participating in intercellular communication. Although these advantages underline the high potential of tumor-derived exosomes as diagnostic biomarkers, the lack of standardized effective methods for their isolation, identification, and precise characterization makes their application challenging in clinical settings. We discuss the importance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cellular processes, and the role of tumor-derived exosomes containing ncRNAs as potential biomarkers in several types of cancer.

These findings suggest that copper(II) complexes could be harnessed as a new approach to modulate immune function in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined the anti-neuroinflammatory action of several low-molecular-weight, charge-neutral and lipophilic copper(II) complexes. Our analysis revealed that one compound, a thiosemicarbazone-pyridylhydrazone copper(II) complex (CuL5), delivered copper into cells in vitro and increased the concentration of copper in the brain in vivo. In a primary murine microglia culture, CuL5 was shown to decrease secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf), increase expression of metallothionein (Mt1), and modulate expression of Alzheimer's disease-associated risk genes, Trem2 and Cd33. CuL5 also improved the phagocytic function of microglia in vitro. In 5xFAD model AD mice, treatment with CuL5 led to an improved performance in a spatial working memory test, while, interestingly, increased accumulation of amyloid plaques in treated mice.

Participants received a course of psychological therapy treatment in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services between 2012 and 2019. Cox proportional hazards models were run to test associations between improvement in depression following psychological therapy and incidence of dementia diagnosis up to eight years later. Improvements in depression following treatment were associated with reduced rates of dementia diagnosis up to 8 years later (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94), after adjustment for key covariates. Strongest effects were observed for vascular dementia (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.97) compared with Alzheimer's disease (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00). Reliable improvement in depression across psychological therapy was associated with reduced incidence of future dementia. Results are consistent with at least two possibilities. Firstly, psychological interventions to improve symptoms of depression may have the potential to contribute to dementia risk reduction efforts. Secondly, psychological therapies may be less effective in people with underlying dementia pathology or they may be more likely to drop out of therapy (reverse causality).

There was a significant genotype\u202f\u00d7\u202fdiet interaction for the liver and hippocampal arachidonic acid (AA). APOE4 mice had 20-30% lower plasma DHA and AA concentrations than APOE3 mice, independent of diet. Plasma and liver DHA levels were significantly correlated in APOE3 and APOE4 mice. In APOE4 mice, there was a significant correlation between plasma, adipose tissues, and cortex DHA and the Barnes maze and/or with a better recognition index. Moreover, higher AA levels in the liver and the hippocampus of APOE4 mice were correlated with lower cognitive performance. Our results suggest that there is a plasma-liver-brain axis of DHA that is modified in APOE4 mice.

In addition to the accumulation of amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), several other alterations have been associated with AD such as calcium (Ca2+) signaling, glucose-, fatty acid-, cholesterol-, and phospholipid metabolism, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, all these processes have been associated with the mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact site (MERCS) signaling hub. We and others have hypothesized that the dysregulated MERCS function may be one of the main pathogenic pathways driving AD pathology. Due to the variety of biological processes overseen at the MERCS, we believe that they constitute unique therapeutic targets to boost the neuronal function and recover neuronal homeostasis. Thus, developing molecules with the capacity to correct and/or modulate the MERCS interplay can unleash unique therapeutic opportunities for AD. The potential pharmacological intervention using MERCS modulators in different models of AD is currently under investigation.

In this sense, autophagy is a promising cellular process to remove these protein aggregates. This study evaluated the autophagy mechanisms involved in neuroprotection induced by 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) in a Tet-On inducible expression tauopathy cell model (EGFP-tau WT or with the P301L mutation, 0N4R isoform). The results indicated that 17\u03b2-estradiol induces autophagy by activating AMPK in a concentration-dependent manner, independent of mTOR signals. The estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) agonist, PPT, also induced autophagy, while the ER\u03b1 antagonist, MPP, substantially attenuated the 17\u03b2-estradiol-mediated autophagy induction.

This article reviews the diversity, constructs, strengths, and limitations of existing environmental assessment tools and identifies gaps for future tool development. A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Avery Index) and terms related to health-care environments and assessment tools. A total of 13 environmental assessment tools for people living with dementia within shared residential settings were identified. Evaluation of the environmental assessment tools includes a synthesis of published data for each tool's reliability, validity, ease of use, interpretability, strengths and weaknesses, as well as a comparison of various tool characteristics including date of development, country of origin, applicable care setting(s), number and variety of measures and underlying constructs, format, and descriptive versus evaluative content. While the shift to person-centered values encompasses all aspects of care and care settings, the majority of person-centered definitions exclude the important role of the designed, physical environment.

Our primary objective was to evaluate the effects of a rare-disease support group leader education program, which was developed collaboratively by researchers, peer support group leaders, and patient organization leaders, compared to waitlist control, on peer leader self-efficacy among scleroderma support group leaders. The trial was a pragmatic, two-arm partially nested randomised controlled trial with 1:1 allocation into intervention or waitlist control.

Using linear mixed models, longitudinal measurements of CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in A+/T-/N- and A+/T+/N+ as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls were performed.

Seq2Morph was built upon VoxelMorph which is a general-purpose framework for learning-based image registration. The major upgrades are 1) expansion of inputs to all weekly CBCTs acquired for monitoring treatment responses throughout a radiotherapy course, for registration to their planning CT; 2) incorporation of 3D convolutional long short-term memory between the encoder and decoder of VoxelMorph, to parse the temporal patterns of anatomical changes; and 3) addition of bidirectional pathways to calculate and minimize inverse consistency errors (ICE). Longitudinal image sets from 50 patients, including a planning CT and six weekly CBCTs per patient were utilized for the network training and cross-validation. The outputs were deformation vector fields for all the registration pairs. The loss function was composed of a normalized cross-correlation for image intensity similarity, a DICE for contour similarity, an ICE, and a deformation regularization term. For performance evaluation, DICE and Hausdorff distance (HD) for the manual vs. predicted contours of tumor and esophagus on weekly basis were quantified and further compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, including conventional VoxelMorph and Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM).

Transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated lysosome biogenesis enhances lysosome-dependent degradation and alleviates neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms underlying TFEB regulation and modification are still poorly understood. By screening novel small-molecule compounds, we identified a group of lysosome-enhancing compounds (LYECs) that promote TFEB activation and lysosome biogenesis. One of these compounds, LH2-051, significantly inhibited the function of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and subsequently promoted lysosome biogenesis. We uncovered cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as a novel regulator of DAT-mediated lysosome biogenesis and identified six novel CDK9-phosphorylated sites on TFEB. We observed that signal transduction by the DAT-CDK9-TFEB axis occurs on lysosomes. Finally, we found that LH2-051 enhanced the degradation of amyloid beta plaques and improved the memory of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Presenilin 1 (PS1) mice. We identified the DAT-CDK9-TFEB signaling axis as a novel regulator of lysosome biogenesis.

Alzheimer Disease (AD) requires new biomarkers in minimally invasive samples that allow an early diagnosis. The aim of this work is to study miRNAS as potential AD biomarkers and their role in the pathology development. In this study, participants (n\u2009=\u200946) were classified into mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD, n\u2009=\u200919), preclinical AD (n\u2009=\u20098) and healthy elderly controls (n\u2009=\u200919), according to CSF biomarkers levels (amyloid \u03b242, total tau, phosphorylated tau) and neuropsychological assessment. Then, plasma miRNAomic expression profiles were analysed by Next Generation Sequencing. Finally, the selected miRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR (q-PCR). A panel of 11 miRNAs was selected from omics expression analysis, and 8 of them were validated by q-PCR. Individually, they did not show statistically significant differences among participant groups. However, a multivariate model including these 8 miRNAs revealed a potential association with AD for three of them. Specifically, relatively lower expression levels of miR-92a-3p and miR-486-5p are observed in AD patients, and relatively higher levels of miR-29a-3p are observed in AD patients. These biomarkers could be involved in the regulation of pathways such as synaptic transmission, structural functions, cell signalling and metabolism or transcription regulation. Some plasma miRNAs (miRNA-92a-3p, miRNA-486-5p, miRNA-29a-3p) are slightly dysregulated in AD, being potential biomarkers of the pathology.

This systematic review followed the PRISMA Statement guidelines through the 27 items on its checklist. We searched in PubMed, BVS, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, using the keywords: Alzheimer's disease, optical coherence tomography, white matter, cortex, atrophy, cortical thickness, neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. We included articles that studied the retina in relation to neuroimaging in patients with AD, MCI, and preclinical AD. We excluded studies without OCT, without neuroimaging, clinical cases, opinion articles, systematic reviews, and animal studies. Of a total of 35 articles found, 23 were finally included. Although mixed results were found, most of these corroborate the relationship between retinal and brain disorders. More rigorous research is needed in the field, including homogenized, longitudinal, and prolonged follow-up studies, as well as studies that include all stages of AD.

We found good correlations between CSF and plasma biomarkers for NfL (rho = 0.668, p < 0.001) and p-tau181 (rho = 0.619, p < 0.001). Plasma NfL was significantly higher in disease groups than in HC and showed a greater increase in FTD than in AD [44.9 (28.1-68.6) vs. 21.9 (17.0-27.9) pg/ml, p < 0.001]. Conversely, plasma p-tau181 and GFAP levels were significantly higher in AD than in FTD [3.2 (2.4-4.3) vs. 1.1 (0.7-1.6) pg/ml, p < 0.001; 404.7 (279.7-503.0) vs. 198.2 (143.9-316.8) pg/ml, p < 0.001]. GFAP also allowed discriminating disease groups from HC. In the distinction between FTD and AD, plasma p-tau181 showed better accuracy (AUC 0.964) than NfL (AUC 0.791) and GFAP (AUC 0.818). In DLB and CBS, CSF amyloid positive (A+) subjects had higher plasma p-tau181 and GFAP levels than A- individuals. CSF RT-QuIC showed positive \u03b1-synuclein seeding activity in 96% DLB and 15% AD patients with no differences in plasma biomarker levels in those stratified by RT-QuIC result. In a single-center clinical cohort, we confirm the high diagnostic value of plasma p-tau181 for distinguishing FTD from AD and plasma NfL for discriminating degenerative dementias from HC. Plasma GFAP alone differentiates AD from FTD and neurodegenerative dementias from HC but with lower accuracy than p-tau181 and NfL.

Logistic regression was used to determine the univariable predictors of HPV infection. The overall detection rate of any viral STI, bacterial STI, pathobiont, genital ulcer, candidiasis, and BV among the AGYW was 75.0, 34.4, 90.7, 14.4, 26.9, and 43.6%, respectively. The main factors associated with HPV infection were alcohol consumption (p = 0.005), infection with any and multiple Candida species (p = 0.011 and 0.006, respectively), Candida albicans infection (p = 0.010), Ureaplasma urealyticum pathobiont infection (p = 0.044), BV-associated bacteria (specifically Atopobium vaginae: p = 0.039, BV-associated bacteria 2: p = 0.021, Gardnerella vaginalis: p = 0.021, Megasphaera type 1: p = 0.037), and BV (p = 0.011).

We have established an approach using intraluminally injected Alexa Fluor\u2122 488 Hydrazide (AH) in preimplantation control (RhoAf/f) and P4-deficient RhoAf/fPgrCre/+ mice. In control mice, bulk entry (seen as smeared cellular staining) via uterine luminal epithelium (LE) decreases from D0.5 to D3.5. In P4-deficient RhoAf/fPgrCre/+ mice, bulk entry on D0.5 and D3.5 is impaired.

ALK, ROS1 and NTRK rearrangements are found in about 2-7%, 1-2% and 0.2% of unselected NSCLC samples, respectively; however, their frequency is markedly higher in younger and never-smoker patients with adenocarcinoma histology. Moreover, ALK, ROS1 and NTRK rearrangements are often mutually exclusive with other known driver alterations in NSCLC. Due to such a low frequency, diagnostic screening with accurate and inexpensive techniques such as immunohistochemistry is useful to identify positive cases; however, confirmation with fluorescent in situ hybridization or next-generation sequencing is often required due to higher specificity. In ALK-rearranged NSCLC, sequential treatment with second-generation and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors leads to long-lasting disease control with most patients surviving beyond 5 years with metastatic disease. In ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, first-line treatment with crizotinib or entrectinib and subsequent treatment with lorlatinib at disease progression leads to similar results in patients with metastatic disease. NTRK1-3 fusions are extremely rare in unselected NSCLC.

Consistently, RAB4A suppression abolished the cancer cells' self-renewal and tumor forming ability. In terms of downstream signaling, we found that RAB4A regulation of EMT is achieved through its control of activation of the RAC1 GTPase. Introducing activated RAC1 efficiently rescued EMT gene expression, invasion and tumor formation suppressed by RAB4A knockdown in both the in vitro and in vivo cancer models.

Therefore, the present study intended to investigate the effect of pCA against rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease-like pathology in mice. Thirty male institute of cancer research (ICR) mice were randomly divided into three experimental groups: Sham-veh, Rot-veh, and Rot-pCA100. Rotenone (Rot) 2.5\u00a0mg/kg was subcutaneously injected every 48\u00a0h in the rotenone groups. Alternately, a 100\u00a0mg/kg pCA dose was given every 48\u00a0h via intragastric gavage to the Rot-pCA100 group for 6\u00a0weeks. Motor ability was assessed at the second, fourth, and sixth week before brain collection for biochemical and histological analyses. Results indicated significant motor deficits appeared from the second to sixth week after rotenone injection. Brain analysis detected a significant effect of rotenone in the increase of malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1).

The aim of this study was to introduce a novel way of classifying between AD patients, MCI subjects, and age-matched healthy control (HC) subjects using EEG-derived feature images and deep learning techniques. The EEG recordings of 141 age-matched subjects (52 AD, 37 MCI, 52 HC) were converted into 2D greyscale images representing the Pearson correlation coefficients and the distance Lempel-Ziv Complexity (dLZC) between the 21 EEG channels.

This paper explores patient and community insights surrounding self-collection among women living with HIV and HIV[-] women as well as the barriers and facilitators to obtaining and utilizing self-collected specimens in cervical cancer screening programs. Materials and methods: We utilized an exploratory qualitative approach to obtain data through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews during data collection that took place from May to August 2018. A two-stage sampling strategy was used to select 80 women who participated in six focus group discussions and eight in-depth interviews. We utilized the socio-ecological framework to guide data analysis. Results: All participants indicated that self-sampling was an acceptable method of specimen collection and should be offered as an option for cervical cancer screening in Cameroon. Whereas, most women, regardless of HIV status, preferred the option for self-collection, barriers were identified, such as lack of education about self-collection procedure, being uncomfortable, embarrassed or in pain from the procedure, fear of consequences, perceived competence about ability to self-collect and privacy and confidentiality.

Assessments included immediate and delayed recall of 3 stories from the Automatic Story Recall Task (ASRT), a test with multiple parallel stimuli (18 short stories and 18 long stories) balanced for key linguistic and discourse metrics. Verbal responses were recorded and securely transferred from participants' personal devices and automatically transcribed and scored using text similarity metrics between the source text and retelling to derive a generalized match score. Group differences in adherence and task performance were examined using logistic and linear mixed models, respectively. Correlational analysis examined parallel-forms reliability of ASRTs and convergent validity with cognitive tests (Logical Memory Test and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite with semantic processing).

Genome-wide bromouridine sequencing analysis to evaluate nascent RNA synthesis showed that the expression of many chemotactic cytokines, especially CXC motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), was upregulated in KDM6A KO PDAC cells. KDM6A-deficient PDAC cells secreted higher levels of CXCL1 protein, which in turn recruited neutrophils. Furthermore, in a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model, treatment with a CXCL1 neutralizing antibody blocked the chemotactic and NET-promoting properties of KDM6A-deficient PDAC cells and suppressed tumor growth, confirming CXCL1 as a key mediator of chemotaxis and PDAC growth driven by KDM6A loss. These findings shed light on how KDM6A regulates the tumor immune microenvironment and PDAC progression and suggests that the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis may be a candidate target in PDAC with KDM6A loss.

Therefore, quality evaluation of sequencing data is also critical for accurate tissue genotyping. Herein, we aimed to developed a grading QC algorithm, and provide a recommendation to refine and optimize NGS-based molecular diagnostic strategies. We interrogated 1260 NSCLC samples using hybrid capture-based targeted DNA NGS, and quantified the sequencing data as high, medium and low quality, according to a grading QC algorithm. Then, we explored the relationship between sequencing quality and sample characteristics, and compared the concordance rates of results between NGS and conventional molecular tests for FFPE samples with variable characteristics. We found that high-quality data were associated with samples with shorter storage time and lower DNA degradation in resection samples, and were associated with intra-hospital samples, adequate DNA quantity, and lower DNA degradation in biopsy samples. Moreover, accurate NGS results can be achieved in samples with high-quality data, but not samples with medium-quality data, especially for rearrangements detection. Our study demonstrates that the real-world clinical adoption of an effective QC strategy for NGS is necessary to ensure accurate results from FFPE samples of NSCLC with variable characteristics.

We harmonised data from 13 longitudinal cohort studies of ageing in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had baseline data for social connection markers and at least two waves of cognitive scores. Follow-up periods ranged from 0 years to 15 years across cohorts. We included participants with cognitive data for at least two waves and social connection data for at least one wave.

The amount and size of pulmonary metastases acquired from MRI imaging data are the important criteria to assess the efficacy of new drugs in preclinical models. While efficient solutions both for MR imaging and the downstream automatic segmentation have been proposed for human patients, both MRI lung imaging and segmentation in preclinical animal models remains challenging due to the physiological motion (respiratory and cardiac movements), to the low amount of protons in this organ and to the particular challenge of precise segmentation of metastases. As a consequence post-mortem analysis is currently required to obtain information on metastatic volume. In this work, we have developed a complete methodological pipeline for automated analysis of lungs and metastases in mice, consisting of an MR sequence for image acquisition and a deep learning method for automatic segmentation of both lungs and metastases. On one hand, we optimized an MR sequence for mouse lung imaging with high contrast for high detection sensitivity. On the other hand we developed DeepMeta, a multiclass U-Net 3+ deep learning model to automatically segment the images. To assess if the proposed deep learning pipeline is able to provide an accurate segmentation of both lungs and pulmonary metastases, we have longitudinally imaged mice with fast- and slow-growing metastasis. Fifty-five balb/c mice were injected with two different derivatives of renal carcinoma cells. Mice were imaged with a SG-bSSFP (self-gated balanced steady state free precession) sequence at different time points after the injection of cancer cells. Both lung and metastases segmentations were manually performed by experts. DeepMeta was trained to perform lung and metastases segmentation based on the resulting ground truth annotations. Volumes of lungs and of pulmonary metastases as well as the number of metastases per mouse were measured on a separate test dataset of MR images. Thanks to the SG method, the 3D bSSFP images of lungs were artifact-free, enabling the downstream detection and serial follow-up of metastases. Moreover, both lungs and metastases segmentation was accurately performed by DeepMeta as soon as they reached the volume of \u223c . Thus we were able to distinguish two groups of mice in terms of number and volume of pulmonary metastases as well as in terms of the slow versus fast patterns of growth of metastases.

Patients who underwent SRS for RCC BMs at the authors' institution between January 2010 and January 2021 were included.

The results of the water maze test showed that after treatment with allantoin, the rats could reduce their swimming time and travel distances to find the platform. Allantoin treatment also increased the time spent in the quadrant in which the platform was located. Histological assessment showed that A\u03b21-42 could cause morphological alterations in nerve cells in the hippocampal CA1 region, and that allantoin could repair the damage to these cells.

All patients underwent at least two spirometry tests. Environmental PM2.5 concentrations in the same period were collected from the nearest monitoring station. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model was employed to investigate the associations between changes in PM2.5 concentrations and LFR in patients who underwent lobectomy after adjusting for potential confounders. We assessed short- and medium-term LFR in patients who underwent lobectomy. The three- and 6-month average PM2.5 concentrations in each patient's residential area were divided into regional mild pollution (PM2.5 <25 \u03bcg/m3), moderate pollution (25 \u03bcg/m3 \u2264 PM2.5 <35 \u03bcg/m3), and severe pollution (35 \u03bcg/m3 \u2264 PM2.5) periods.

The sorting of this enzyme into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes regulates the BACE1-mediated cleavage of its substrates, however, the mechanisms underlying this targeting remain poorly understood. The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface. Of note, shedding of the extracellular domain of Sez6, a protein cleaved exclusively by BACE1, is reduced in NCAM2-deficient animals.

Notably, acquired resistance to PARPis caused by point mutations in the PARP1 protein is hard to overcome with current strategies. To explore modalities to overcome resistance and identify patients who are most likely to benefit from PARP1-targeted therapy, we developed a proteolysis-targeted chimaera (PROTAC) to degrade mutant PARP1 in TNBC. Here, we investigated a PARP1 PROTAC termed \"NN3\", which triggered ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of PARP1. Moreover, NN3 degraded PARP1 with resistance-related mutations. Interestingly, compared with other reported PARP1 degraders, NN3 exhibited a unique antitumor mechanism in p53-positive breast cancer cells that effectively promoted ferroptosis by downregulating the SLC7A11 pathway.

We evaluated a web-based intervention, Nuts & Bolts, designed to provide support and alleviate distress after diagnosis of testicular cancer. Using a mixed methods design to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and impact of Nuts & Bolts on distress, we randomly assigned participants with recently diagnosed testicular cancer (1:1) access to Nuts & Bolts at the time of consent (early) or alternatively, 1 week later (day 8; delayed). Participants completed serial questionnaires across a 4- to 5-week period to evaluate levels of distress (measured by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer [DT]; scored 0-10), anxiety, and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score [HADS]-Anxiety and HADS-Depression; each scored 0-21). The primary end point was change in distress between consent and day 8. Secondary end points of distress, anxiety, and depression were assessed at defined intervals during follow-up. Optional, semistructured interviews occurring after completion of quantitative assessments were thematically analyzed. Overall, 39 participants were enrolled in this study. The median time from orchidectomy to study consent was 14.8 (range 3-62) days.

A higher baseline DT score was significantly predictive of reduction in DT score during this period (P<.001).

Symptoms eventually become severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. Understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of AD is necessary for the development of strategies for AD prevention and/or treatment, and modeling of this pathology is an important step in achieving this goal. \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) injection is a widely used approach for modeling AD. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the model constructed by injection of A\u03b2 in combination with a prooxidant cocktail (ferrous sulfate, A\u03b2, and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (FAB)) best reflects the natural development of this disease. The relationship between oxidative stress and A\u03b2 deposition and their respective roles in A\u03b2-induced pathology in different animal models of AD have been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we compared the effects of A\u03b2 1-42 alone with that of A\u03b2-associated oxidative stress induced by the FAB cocktail on the neurodegeneration of hippocampal cells in vitro. We constructed a FAB-induced AD model using rat primary hippocampal cells and analyzed the contribution of each compound. The study mainly focused on the prooxidant aspects of AD pathogenesis. Moreover, cellular bioenergetics was assessed and routine metabolic tests were performed to determine the usefulness of this model. The data clearly show that aggregated A\u03b21-42 alone is significantly less toxic to hippocampal cells. Aggregated A\u03b2 damages neurons, and glial cells proliferate to remove A\u03b2 from the hippocampus. External prooxidant agents (Fe2+) or inhibition of internal antioxidant defense by BSO has more toxic effects on hippocampal cells than aggregated A\u03b2 alone. Moreover, hippocampal cells fight against A\u03b2-induced damage more effectively than against oxidative damage. However, the combination of A\u03b2 with external oxidative damage and inhibition of internal antioxidant defense is even more toxic, impairs cellular defense systems, and may mimic the late phase of AD-associated cell damage.

Patients' demographic and clinical data including age, BMI, cancer stage, tumor differentiation, invasion, and lymph node metastasis were collected. All patients were followed for 5 years following surgery. Results: Deceased patients showed significantly higher ratios of: FIGO stage III-IV tumors; low tumor differentiation; myometrial invasion depths of >1/2 and cervical invasion. Lymph node metastases and distant metastasis were significantly lower in surviving patients than those in deceased patients. The serum levels of SOX2 were significantly higher in endometrial carcinoma patients compared with the healthy controls and were remarkably higher in deceased patients.

Intriguingly, some evidence has suggested that dormancy is a reversible state that is switched 'on' or 'off' depending on the presence of various bone marrow resident cells, particularly osteoclasts and osteoblasts. It has become clear that these two cells contribute to regulating dormant tumour cells in bone both directly (interaction) and indirectly (secreted factors). The involved mechanisms include TGF\u03b2 signalling, the Wnt signalling axis, the Notch2 pathway, etc. There is no detailed review that specifically focuses on ascertaining the dynamic interactions between tumour cell dormancy and bone remodelling.

CRG changes were characterized at the genomic and transcriptional levels in 656 OC samples, and their expression patterns were investigated using three different datasets. We identified three distinct molecular subtypes, and discovered that variations in molecular subtypes were linked to patient prognosis, TME cell infiltration characteristics, malignancy, and immune-related pathways. Then, in order to predict overall survival (OS), we created a risk score and tested its predictive potential in OC patients. As a result, we created a very accurate nomogram to increase risk score clinical applicability. Better OS, younger age, early stage, and immune activity were all associated with a low risk score. The hallmarks of a high-risk score are older age, advanced stage, immunosuppression, and a bad prognosis. Furthermore, risk score was linked to immune checkpoint expression (including PD-L1, CTLA4), targeted therapy gene expression (PARP, PDGFRA), cancer stem cell (CSC), chemotherapy and targeted medication sensitivity.

Lower density indicates larger adipocytes with greater lipid content, whereas higher density can reflect inflammation, fibrosis, vascularity, or even metabolic changes; and both may impact breast cancer prognosis. We included 2868 nonmetastatic patients with breast cancer diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2013\u00a0at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated healthcare system. From CT scans at diagnosis, we assessed the radiodensity of subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) at the third lumbar vertebra and categorized their radiodensity into three levels: low (<1 standard deviation [SD] below the mean), middle (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 SD), and high (>1 SD above the mean). Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for clinicopathological characteristics including body mass index, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs [95% confidence intervals]) for the associations of adipose tissue radiodensity with overall mortality and breast-cancer-specific mortality. Median age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 56.0 years, most (63.3%) were non-Hispanic White and nearly half (45.6%) were stage II. Compared to middle SAT radiodensity, high SAT radiodensity was significantly associated with increased risk of overall mortality (HR: 1.45 [1.15-1.81]), non-significantly with breast-cancer-specific mortality (HR: 1.32 [0.95-1.84]). Neither low SAT radiodensity nor high or low VAT radiodensity was significantly associated with overall or breast-cancer-specific mortality.

The olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) secreting neurotropic and anti-inflammatory factors have a high migration capacity, making them applicable for gene therapy. We examined our new construct OECs containing the HSV-tk gene for their migration and tumoricidal ability in animal models of GBM. Isolated OECs were transduced by the HSV-tk gene (OEC-tks). OEC-tks or PBS were injected ipsilaterally or contralaterally into the tumor-bearing rats, followed by gancyclovir (GCV) or PBS administration. At the end of the treatment, tumor size, apoptosis, and animal survival were assessed. Our findings demonstrated that tumor size was significantly decreased in OEC-tks ipsilateral and contralateral groups, followed by GCV injections. Furthermore, both groups' pro-apoptotic protein and gene expressions were up-regulated, whereas Bcl-2 protein expression was down-regulated. Besides, apoptosis in the OEC-tks ipsilateral/GCV group was higher in the intratumoral region, and this percentage was higher in the OEC-tks contralateral/GCV group in the peritumoral region.

In this study, a targeted carrier for co-delivery was prepared based on low molecular weight polyethylenimine (LMW PEI). Paclitaxel was covalently conjugated onto PEI via a succinate linker. The PEI conjugate was decorated with L-DOPA in order to target large neutral amino acid transporter-1 (LAT-1) that is over-expressed on various cancer cells. This PEI conjugate was complexed with human ABCB1 shRNA plasmid to down-regulate the expression of P-glycoprotein, as one of the major efflux pumps inducing resistance against chemotherapeutics. The formation of PEI conjugate enhanced the solubility of PTX and resulted in the condensation and protection of plasmid DNA in nano-sized polyplexes. The results of targeted delivery into the cells demonstrated that the PEI conjugate transferred the payloads to the cells over-expressing LAT-1 transporter, while the biological effects on the cells lacking the transporter was negligible. Also, shRNA-mediated down-regulation of P-gp led to the increase of toxic effects on the cells over-expressing P-gp.

Among environmental factors, the microbiota are linked to the development of different autoimmune diseases. The microbiota in the nasal cavity and gut are involved in SLE development, but the influence of skin microbiota is still unclear. Here, we demonstrated that epithelial cell-specific I\u03baB\u03b6-deficient (Nfkbiz\u0394K5) mice showed spontaneous skin inflammation with increased abundance of Staphylococcus aureus on the skin.

The obtained EM and EM-Dox were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western Blot assay(WB), and the yield of exosomes and EM was further compared. Confocal fluorescent microscopy was used to verify the uptake of EM-Dox and free doxorubicin (Free-Dox) by NB cells.

Objective: To evaluate the risk of central nervous system (CNS) depression, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, and mortality of combination therapy compared with those of opioid therapy and to explore the differences in the results according to study design and indications. Methods: Relevant studies were selected (published before 30 January 2022) by searching the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. The pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the outcomes were estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel method.

Quality assessment was conducted using the Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias in non-RCTs tool for non-randomized trials. Results: Adverse events were reported in 26 RCTs and 7 non-RCTs, and mortality was reported in 10 non-RCTs.

All the top two drug candidates interacted with residues Ser-372 and Gly-369 in close proximity with the iron-binding domain (an important catalyst of metal reduction).

We aim to assess all previously identified circulating microRNA signatures as potential biomarkers of genetic FTD and/or ALS, using homogeneous, independent validation cohorts of C9orf72 and GRN mutation carriers. 104 individuals carrying a C9orf72 or a GRN mutation, along with 31 controls, were recruited through the French research network on FTD/ALS. All subjects underwent blood sampling, from which circulating microRNAs were extracted. We measured differences in the expression levels of 65 microRNAs, selected from 15 published studies about FTD or ALS, between 31 controls, 17 C9orf72 presymptomatic subjects, and 29 C9orf72 patients. We also assessed differences in the expression levels of 30 microRNAs, selected from five studies about FTD, between 31 controls, 30 GRN presymptomatic subjects, and 28 GRN patients. More than half (35/65) of the selected microRNAs were differentially expressed in the C9orf72 cohort, while only a small proportion (5/30) of microRNAs were differentially expressed in the GRN cohort. In multivariate analyses, only individuals in the C9orf72 cohort could be adequately classified (ROC AUC up to 0.98 for controls versus presymptomatic subjects, 0.94 for controls versus patients, and 0.77 for presymptomatic subjects versus patients) with some of the signatures.

The overall aim of this research was to understand how steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis is managed in adult secondary care and how current practice compares with patient and health-care professional preferences. A mixed-methods study, including an online survey, qualitative interviews and discrete choice experiments. NHS inflammatory bowel disease services in the UK. Adults with ulcerative colitis and health-care professionals treating inflammatory bowel disease.

The interviews with and survey of health-care professionals showed that most health-care professionals define steroid resistance as an incomplete response to 40\u2009mg per day of prednisolone after 2 weeks. The survey also found that anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs (particularly infliximab) are the most frequently offered drugs across most steroid-resistant (and steroid-dependent) patient scenarios, but they are less frequently offered to thiopurine-naive patients. Patient interviews identified several factors influencing their treatment choices, including effectiveness of treatment, recommendations from health-care professionals, route of administration and side effects. Over time, depending on the severity and duration of symptoms and, crucially, as medical treatment options become exhausted, patients are willing to try alternative treatments and, eventually, to undergo surgery. The discrete choice experiments found that the probability of remission and of side effects strongly influences the treatment choices of both patients and health-care professionals. Patients are less likely to choose a treatment that takes longer to improve symptoms. Health-care professionals are willing to make difficult compromises by tolerating greater safety risks in exchange for therapeutic benefits. The treatments ranked most positively by patients were infliximab and tofacitinib (each preferred by 38% of patients), and the predicted probability of uptake by health-care professionals was greatest for infliximab (62%). The survey and the discrete choice experiments with patients and health-care professionals are limited by their relatively small sample sizes. The qualitative studies are subject to selection bias. The timing of the different substudies, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, is a potential limitation. We have identified factors influencing treatment decisions for steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis and the characteristics to consider when choosing treatments to evaluate in future randomised controlled trials. The findings may be used to improve discussions between patients and health-care professionals when they review treatment options for steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis. This research highlights the need for consensus work to establish an agreed definition of steroid resistance in ulcerative colitis and a greater understanding of the optimal use of tofacitinib and surgery for this patient group. A randomised controlled trial comparing infliximab with tofacitinib is also recommended.

However, it is still unknown if these alterations can be found in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and whether they are more pronounced than changes found in conventional brain volumetric measurements. To address these questions, we investigated microstructural alterations of two major cholinergic pathways in individuals along the AD continuum using an in vivo model of the human cholinergic system based on neuroimaging. We included 405 participants (53 AD, 66 MCI, 174 SCD, and 112 healthy controls) from the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE). We modelled the cholinergic white matter pathways with an enhanced diffusion neuroimaging pipeline that included probabilistic fiber-tracking methods and prior anatomical knowledge. The integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was compared between stages of the AD continuum, in the whole cohort and in a CSF amyloid-beta stratified subsample. The discriminative power of the integrity of the pathways was compared to the conventional volumetric measures of hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. A multivariate model was employed to investigate the role of these pathways in relation to cognitive performance. We found that the integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was significantly reduced in all stages of the AD continuum, including individuals with SCD. The differences involved posterior cholinergic white matter in the SCD stage and extended to anterior frontal white matter in MCI and AD dementia stages. Both cholinergic pathways and conventional volumetric measures showed higher predictive power in the more advanced stages of the disease, i.e., MCI and AD dementia. In contrast, the integrity of cholinergic pathways was more informative in distinguishing SCD from healthy controls, as compared with the volumetric measures. The multivariate model revealed a moderate contribution of the cholinergic white matter pathways but not of volumetric measures towards memory tests in the SCD and MCI stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cholinergic white matter pathways are altered already in SCD individuals, preceding the more widespread alterations found in MCI and AD. The integrity of the cholinergic pathways identified the early stages of AD better than conventional volumetric measures such as hippocampal volume or volume of cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36130116": {"ArticleTitle": "Alterations in resting-state functional connectivity associated to the age-related decline in time-based prospective memory.", "AbstractText": "Time-based prospective memory (TBPM) is defined as the ability to remember to perform intended actions at a specific time in the future.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate whether a previously validated radiomics signature of CD8 T-cells could predict progressions at a lesion level and whether the spatial heterogeneity of this radiomics score could be used at a patient level to assess the clinical response and survival of melanoma patients. Clinical data from patients with advanced melanoma treated in our center with immunotherapy were retrieved. Radiomic features were extracted and the CD8 radiomics signature was applied. A progressive lesion was defined by an increase in lesion size of 20% or more. Dispersion metrics of the radiomics signature were estimated to evaluate the impact of interlesion heterogeneity on patient's response. Fine-tuned cut-offs for predicting overall survival were evaluated after splitting data into training and test sets. A total of 136 patients were included in this study, with 1120 segmented lesions at baseline, and 1052 lesions at first evaluation. A low CD8 radiomics score at baseline was associated with a significantly higher risk of lesion progression (AUC=0.55, p=0.0091), especially for lesions larger than >1 mL (AUC=0.59 overall, p=0.0035, with AUC=0.75, p=0.002 for subcutaneous lesions, AUC=0.68, p=0.01, for liver lesions and AUC=0.62, p=0.03 for nodes).

Metastasis plays a critical role in tumor progression, and vascular invasion is considered one of the most crucial factors for HCC metastasis. However, comprehensive analysis focusing on competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and immune infiltration in the vascular invasion of HCC is lacking. Methods: The gene expression profiles of 321 samples, including 210 primary HCC cases and 111 HCC cases with vascular invasion, were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma project, and used in identifying significant differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and mRNAs (DEmRNAs). The RNAs associated with vascular invasion were used in constructing a ceRNA network. A multigene-based risk signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. We detected the fractions of 28 immune cell types in HCC through single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Finally, the relationship between the ceRNA network and immune cells was determined through correlation analysis and used in clarifying the potential mechanism involved in vascular invasion. Results: Overall, 413 DElncRNAs, 27 DEmiRNAs, and 397 DEmRNAs were recognized in HCC. A specific ceRNA network based on the interaction among 3 lncRNA-miRNA pairs and 24 miRNA-mRNA pairs were established. A ceRNA-based prognostic signature was constructed and used in dividing samples into high- and low-risk subgroups. The signature showed significant efficacy; its 3- and 5-year areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.712 and 0.653, respectively. ceRNA and ssGSEA integration analysis demonstrated that PART1 (p = 0, R = -0.33) and CDK5R2 (p = 0.01, R = -0.15) were negatively correlated to natural killer cells. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that vascular invasion in HCC might be related to PART1, and its role in regulating CDK5R2 and NK cells.

Much of our current knowledge surrounding the FRT microbiota relates to the vaginal microbiota, where 'health' has long been associated with low bacterial diversity and Lactobacillus dominance. This concept has recently been challenged as women can have a diverse vaginal microbial composition in the absence of symptomatic disease. The structures of the upper FRT (the endocervix, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries) have distinct, lower biomass microbiotas than the vagina; however, the existence of permanent microbiotas at these sites is disputed. During homeostasis, a balance exists between the FRT bacteria and the immune system that maintains immune quiescence. Alterations in the bacteria, immune system, or local environment may result in perturbances to the FRT microbiota, defined as dysbiosis. The inflammatory signature of a perturbed or \"dysbiotic\" FRT microbiota is characterized by elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cervical and vaginal fluid. It appears that vaginal homeostasis can be disrupted by two different mechanisms: first, a shift toward increased bacterial diversity can trigger vaginal inflammation, and second, local immunity is altered in some manner, which disrupts the microbiota in response to an environmental change. FRT dysbiosis can have negative effects on reproductive health. This review will examine the increasing evidence for the involvement of the FRT microbiotas and inflammation in gynecologic conditions such as endometriosis, infertility, and endometrial and ovarian cancer; however, the precise mechanisms by which bacteria are involved in these conditions remains speculative at present. While only in their infancy, the use of antibiotics and probiotics to therapeutically alter the FRT microbiota is being studied and is discussed herein.

We wondered if mitochondrial calpains exist in skeletal myoblast and their potential role in myoblast apoptosis of cancer cachexia. We used a transwell to build a novel myoblast-carcinoma cell coculture model to simulate the cancer cachexia environment in vitro.

We found for the first time that two calpains (calpain-1 and calpain-2) and CAST were present in the mitochondria of myoblast. The activation of mitochondrial calpain decreased mitochondrial complex I activity, promoted mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and impaired mitochondrial membrane potential in myoblast during coculture, which induced myoblasts apoptosis. CAST and CAPT protected myoblasts from apoptosis by inhibiting mitochondrial calpain activity, which may attenuate or even reverse cancer cachectic muscle atrophy by improving muscle regeneration ability.

A\u03b2 peptide is produced through cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta secretase BACE1. However, this is precluded by cleavage of APP by the non-amyloidogenic alpha secretase, ADAM10. Previous studies have found that BACE1 expression was increased in the CNS of PWH with HAND as well as animal models of HAND. Further, BACE1 contributed to neurotoxicity. Yet in in vitro models, the role of ADAM10 and its potential regulatory mechanisms had not been examined. To address this, primary rat cortical neurons were treated with supernatants from HIV-infected human macrophages (HIV/MDMs). We found that HIV/MDMs decreased levels of both ADAM10 and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a regulator of ADAM10 that is implicated in aging and in AD. Both decreases were blocked with NMDA receptor antagonists, and treatment with NMDA was sufficient to induce reduction in ADAM10 and SIRT1 protein levels.

Univariate and adjusted multivariate survival models were applied to both sets of data. As determined with adjusted logistic regression models, women under 40 years old at diagnosis had 1.55 times the odds of NM as women 60-69 years of age. The odds of NM for (HR = hormone receptor) HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes were significantly lower than those for HR+/HER2-. In subtype-stratified adjusted models, age of diagnosis had a consistent trend of decreasing odds of NM by age category, most noticeable for HR+ subtypes of luminal A and B. Univariate 5-year survival by age was worst for women under 40 years, with NM attributable for 49% of the hazard of death from cancer in adjusted multivariate models. Lymph node metastasis is age-dependent, yet not all molecular subtypes are clearly affected by this relationship. For <40-yr-old women, NM is a major cause for shorter survival.

A\u03b242 can undergo abnormal aggregation and amyloidogenesis in the brain, forming fibrillar plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The insoluble fibrillar forms of A\u03b242 exhibit well-defined, cross \u03b2-sheet structures at the molecular level and are less toxic than the soluble, intermediate disordered oligomeric forms. However, the mechanism of initial interaction of monomers and subsequent oligomerization is not well understood. The structural disorder of A\u03b242 adds to the challenges of determining the structural properties of its monomers, making it difficult to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenic aggregation. Certain regions of A\u03b242 are known to exhibit helical propensity in different physiological conditions. NMR spectroscopy has shown that the A\u03b242 monomer at lower pH can adopt an \u03b1-helical conformation and as the pH is increased, the peptide switches to \u03b2-sheet conformation and aggregation occurs. CD spectroscopy studies of aggregation have shown the presence of an initial spike in the amount of \u03b1-helical content at the start of aggregation. Such an increase in \u03b1-helical content suggests a mechanism wherein the peptide can expose critical non-polar residues for interaction, leading to hydrophobic aggregation with other interacting peptides. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize in detail the conformational landscape of monomeric A\u03b242 in solution to identify molecular properties that may mediate the early stages of oligomerization. We hypothesized that conformations with \u03b1-helical structure have a higher probability of initiating aggregation because they increase the hydrophobicity of the peptide. Although random coil conformations were found to be the most dominant, as expected, \u03b1-helical conformations are thermodynamically accessible, more so than \u03b2-sheet conformations. Importantly, for the first time \u03b1-helical conformations are observed to increase the exposure of aromatic and hydrophobic residues to the aqueous solvent, favoring their hydrophobically driven interaction with other monomers to initiate aggregation.

Parents used a variety of behavioral, cognitive, and affective coping strategies which evolved throughout their SCID journeys. Some parents reported coping by playing an active role in their child's treatment, which included reaching out to other SCID parents or seeking second medical opinions. Other types of coping included establishing house hygiene rules, thinking positively about the child's treatment progress, and relying on family members for help.

Our lab previously reported that caspase-2 protein levels are elevated in these diseases, leading us to hypothesize that elevated caspase-2 protein levels are due to increased transcription of caspase-2 mRNA. There are two major isoforms of caspase-2 mRNA, caspase-2L and caspase-2S. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the levels of these mRNA isoforms normalized to levels of RPL13 mRNA, a reference gene that showed no disease-associated changes. Here, we report no increases in caspase-2L mRNA levels in any of the three diseases studied, AD (with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), HD and LBD, disproving our hypothesis. Caspase-2S mRNA showed a non-significant downward trend in AD. We also analyzed expression levels of SNAP25 and \u03b2III-tubulin mRNA. SNAP25 mRNA was significantly lower in AD and there were downward trends in MCI, LBD, and HD. \u03b2III-tubulin mRNA expression remained unchanged between disease groups and controls.

A retrospective study was conducted to train and evaluate our model using cine MRI data from patients undergoing treatment for abdominal and thoracic tumors. For each treatment fraction, MR-LINAC delivery log files, tracking videos, and cine DICOM files were analyzed. Individual MRI frames were temporally sampled to construct a large set of image registration pairs used to evaluate multiple methods. The DL model was optimized using five-fold cross validation, and model outputs (transformed images and MVFs) using test set images were saved for comparison with three conventional registration methods (affine, b-spline, and demons). Evaluation metrics were three-fold: 1) registration error, 2) MVF stability (both spatial and temporal), and 3) average computation time. We analyzed >21 hours of cine MRI (>629,000 frames) acquired during 86 treatment fractions from 21 patients.

At sequence identity of 75% and medium compression, PSS-minimap had only 37% as many unmapped reads, and 8% fewer of the reads that did map were incorrectly mapped.

Polymorphism in GST genes in North-Indian BC patients was assessed by multiplex-PCR and PCR-RFLP methods. 105 BC patients and 145 healthy controls were enrolled for this study. Data was analyzed by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI from logistic regression analyses. Our findings revealed that GSTM1 null genotype (OR = 2.231; 95% CI = 1.332-3.737; p-value= 0.002) is significantly associated to BC risk in ethnic North- Indian population. However, the risk for BC susceptibility in North-Indians does not appear to be associated with GSTT1 null genotype. The GSTP1 (Val/Val) genotype (OR=1.545; CI=0.663-3.605; p-value= 0.314) was also found to be susceptible for BC risk. Combination of three high risk GST genotypes association exhibiting gene-gene interaction further confirmed the increased risk to BC in this region. The results of present study indicated that polymorphism in GSTM1 and rs1695 of GSTP1 genes may influence BC development among North-Indian women. Thus, the screening of GSTM1 and GSTP1 gene should be recommended for the earlier investigation for BC as a precautionary measure.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36307633": {"ArticleTitle": "3D-Printed Tumor Phantoms for Assessment of In Vivo Fluorescence Imaging Analysis Methods.", "AbstractText": "Interventional fluorescence imaging is increasingly being utilized to quantify cancer biomarkers in both clinical and preclinical models, yet absolute quantification is complicated by many factors. The use of optical phantoms has been suggested by multiple professional organizations for quantitative performance assessment of fluorescence guidance imaging systems. This concept can be further extended to provide standardized tools to compare and assess image analysis metrics. 3D-printed fluorescence phantoms based on solid tumor models were developed with representative bio-mimicking optical properties. Phantoms were produced with discrete tumors embedded with an NIR fluorophore of fixed concentration and either zero or 3% non-specific fluorophore in the surrounding material. These phantoms were first imaged by two fluorescence imaging systems using two methods of image segmentation, and four assessment metrics were calculated to demonstrate variability in the quantitative assessment of system performance. The same analysis techniques were then applied to one tumor model with decreasing tumor fluorophore concentrations. These anatomical phantom models demonstrate the ability to use 3D printing to manufacture anthropomorphic shapes with a wide range of reduced scattering (\u03bcs': 0.24-1.06\u00a0mm-1) and absorption (\u03bca: 0.005-0.14\u00a0mm-1) properties. The phantom imaging and analysis highlight variability in the measured sensitivity metrics associated with tumor visualization. 3D printing techniques provide a platform for demonstrating complex biological models that introduce real-world complexities for quantifying fluorescence image data. Controlled iterative development of these phantom designs can be used as a tool to advance the field and provide context for consensus-building beyond performance assessment of fluorescence imaging platforms, and extend support for standardizing how quantitative metrics are extracted from imaging data and reported in literature.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36211330": {"ArticleTitle": "Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals the shared mechanisms inducing cognitive impairment between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like cognitive impairment, a kind of Neuro-COVID syndrome, is a reported complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

(Chinese: Caowu/), are a kind of important Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with great medicinal value. Statistics show that there are over 600 efficient TCM formulations comprising Aconitum medicinal materials. But high toxicity limits their clinical application. Clinically, the Aconitum medicinal materials must undergo a complex processing process that includes soaking, steaming, and boiling with pharmaceutical excipients, which makes highly toxic ester diterpenoid alkaloids are hydrolyzed to form less toxic aminoalcohol-diterpenoid alkaloids (ADAs). This review aims to summarize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological activities of low-toxicity ADAs, providing a reference for future ADAs research and drug development. Accessible literature on ADAs published between 1984 and 2022 were screened and obtained from available electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct and Google Scholar, followed by systematic analysis. ADAs are secondary products of plant metabolism, widely distributed in the Aconitum species and Delphinium species. The toxicity of ADAs as pharmacodynamic components of Aconitum medicinal materials is much lower than that of other diterpenoid alkaloids due to the absence of ester bonds. On the one hand, the pharmacokinetics of ADAs have received little attention compared to other toxic alkaloids. The research primarily focuses on aconine and mesaconine. According to existing studies, ADAs absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is primarily passive with a short Tmax. Simultaneously, efflux transporters have less impact on ADAs absorption than non-ADAs. After entering the body, ADAs are widely distributed in the heart, liver, lungs, and kidney, but less in the brain. Notably, aconine is not well metabolized by liver microsomes. Aconine and mesaconine are excreted in urine and feces, respectively. ADAs, on the other hand, have been shown to have a variety of pharmacological activities, including cardiac, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and regenerative effects via regulating multiple signaling pathways, including Nrf2/ARE, PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/Chop, ERK/CREB, NF-\u03baB, Bcl-2/Bax, and GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways.

Dietary intakes were assessed in a personal interview using a valid and reliable semi-quantitative 168-item food frequency questionnaire. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of breast cancer across tertiles of the MIND diet were determined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis. In the crude model, participants in the highest tertiles had lower odds of BC [(OR\u2009=\u20090.57; 95% CI,0.34-0.95), P for trend\u2009=\u20090.020)] than those with the lowest scores on the MIND diet. After controlling for potential confounding variables, individuals in the highest tertile of the MIND diet had a 45% lower risk of BC [(OR\u2009=\u20090.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.96), P for trend\u2009=\u20090.021)] compared with those in the lowest tertile. Also, in women with an abortion history, higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a lower risk of BC [(OR\u2009=\u20090.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.52, P for trend\u2009=\u20090.002)].

Caffeine is one of the well-known central nervous system(CNS)-active natural products. Besides its CNS stimulant properties, it is a mild inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and possesses memory-enhancing properties. The present work aimed to improve the AChE inhibition activity of the caffeine. The rationally designed caffeine-based triazoles were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for cholinesterase and \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) inhibitory activities. The attachment of triazole to the caffeine enhances its AChE inhibition activity from half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) of 129 \u00b5M\u00a0to\u00a00.49\u2009\u00b5M (derivative, 6l). The caffeine core interacts with the peripheral anionic site, whereas the benzyl triazole occupies the catalytic anionic site located at the bottom of the active site gorge. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the four-atom ester linker is superior to shorter linkers for connecting the caffeine core to the triazole. The 2,6-difluorobenzyl triazole-linked caffeine derivative, 6d, exhibits dual inhibition of AChE and BACE-1 with IC50 values of 1.43 and 10.9\u2009\u00b5M, respectively. The derivative 6d inhibits AChE via a mixed-type mode with an inhibition rate constant\u00a0(Ki ) value of 2.35\u2009\u03bcM, which was corroborated by docking studies. The triazole 6d has an acceptable stability profile in human liver microsomes (t1/2 \u2009=\u200954\u2009min) and was found to possess\u00a0CNS permeability\u00a0when evaluated using the parallel artificial membrane permeability blood-brain barrier assay.

The administration of exogenous plant-type ceramides into AD model mice can promote the release of neuronal exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicles, that can mediate A\u03b2 clearance. In vitro studies showed that the length of fatty acids in mammalian-type ceramides is crucial for promoting neuronal exosome release. Therefore, investigating the structures of plant ceramides is important for evaluating the potential in releasing exosomes to remove A\u03b2. In this study, we assessed plant ceramide species with D-erythro-(4E,8Z)-sphingadienine and D-erythro-(8Z)-phytosphingenine as sphingoid bases that differ from mammalian-type species. Some plant ceramides were more effective than mammalian ceramides at stimulating exosome release. In addition, using deuterium chemistry-based lipidomics, most exogenous plant ceramides were confirmed to be derived from exosomes. These results suggest that the ceramide-dependent upregulation of exosome release may promote the release of exogenous ceramides from cells, and plant ceramides with long-chain fatty acids can effectively release neuronal exosomes and prevent AD pathology.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36307152": {"ArticleTitle": "Tumoral melanosis mimicking residual melanoma in the setting of talimogene laherparepvec treatment.", "AbstractText": "Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) has become an increasingly popular treatment option for surgically non-resectable, recurrent melanoma, usually of cutaneous metastases.

Loss of IK altered the sub-/cellular K+- and Ca2+- homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane potential, ultimately resulting in reduced ATP-production and metabolic activity. Consequently, we find that BC cells lacking IK upregulate AMP-activated protein kinase activity to induce autophagy compensating the glycolytic and mitochondrial energy shortage.

Many individuals living with cancer experienced unmet needs and distress throughout the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, irrespective of cancer type, stage, and demographic factors.

We performed quantitative lipoprotein analysis in a local cohort of cognitively impaired elderly and control subjects using standardized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A commercially available quantitative NMR-based assay covering 112 lipoprotein main and subtype variables was used to investigate blood serum samples from a moderate cohort size of 161 persons (71 female, 90 male), including measures of quality control. Additionally, clinical metadata and cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers were collected and used for analysis. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) HDL-4 subfraction levels were mostly high in female individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by AD. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) LDL-2 cholesterol was slightly elevated in male AD patients. HDL-2 apolipoprotein Apo-A1, HDL-2 phospholipids, and HDL-3 triglycerides were highly abundant in AD and MCI women compared to men. When considering clinical biomarkers (A\u03b2, tau), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) VLDL-1 and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) triglycerides were substantially higher in AD compared to MCI. In addition, triglyceride levels correlated positively with dementia. Different lipoprotein serum patterns were identified for AD, MCI, and control subjects. Interestingly, HDL-4 and LDL-2 cholesterol parameters revealed strong gender-specific changes in the context of AD-driven dementia. As gender-based comparisons were based on smaller sub-groups with a low n-number, several statistical findings did not meet the significance threshold for multiple comparisons testing. Still, our finding suggests that serum HDL-4 parameters and various triglycerides correlate positively with AD pathology which could be a read-out of extended lipids traveling through the blood-brain barrier, supporting amyloid plaque formation processes. Thereof, we see herein a proof of concept that this quantitative NMR-based lipoprotein assay can generate important and highly interesting data for refined AD diagnosis and patient stratification, especially when larger cohorts are available.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36273219": {"ArticleTitle": "Plasma proteome profiling identifies changes associated to AD but not to FTD.", "AbstractText": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), characterized mainly by inclusions of Tau (FTLD-Tau) or TAR DNA binding43 (FTLD-TDP) proteins.

Logistic lasso regression was used to identify plasma protein panels discriminating FTD from non-demented controls and AD, or FTLD-Tau from FTLD-TDP. Performance of the discriminatory plasma protein panels was based on predictions obtained from bootstrapping with 1000 resampled analysis. Overall plasma protein expression profiles differed between FTD, AD and controls (6 proteins; p\u2009=\u20090.005), but none of the plasma proteins was specifically associated to FTD. The overall tissue protein expression profile differed between FTD and controls (7-proteins; p\u2009=\u20090.003).

From this perspective, diving deeper into the particularities of the parietal lobe is of paramount importance. In this article, we discuss the functions of the parietal lobe, review the parietal anatomical and pathophysiological peculiarities in AD, and also describe some of the changes in the parietal region that occur after VI. Although the alterations in the hippocampus and the temporal lobe have been well documented in AD, the alterations of the parietal lobe have been less thoroughly explored. Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed that some metabolic and perfusion impairments along with a reduction of the white and grey matter could take place in the parietal lobe during AD. Conversely, it has been speculated that blinding ocular diseases induce a remodeling of the parietal region which is observable through the improvement of the integration of multimodal stimuli and in the increase of the volume of this cortical region.

Recent genome-wide analyses show that the regulation of brain genes requires the contribution of both promoter and long-distance enhancer elements, which must functionally interact with upregulated gene expression in response to physiological cues. Hence, a deep comprehension of the mechanisms mediating these enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) is critical if we are to understand the processes associated with learning, memory and recall. Moreover, the onset and progression of several neurodegenerative diseases and neurological alterations are found to be strongly associated with changes in the components that support and/or modulate the dynamics of these EPIs.

Our study sample consisted of 982 cognitively healthy female and male older participants from the Vallecas Project cohort, without a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The learning rate across the three consecutive recall trials of the verbal memory task (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) recall trials was used as a predictor of grey matter (GM) using voxel-based morphometry, and WM microstructure using tract-based spatial statistics on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measures. Immediate Recall improved by 1.4 items per trial on average, and this episodic learning rate was faster in women and negatively associated with age. Structurally, hippocampal and anterior thalamic GM volume correlated positively with learning rate. Learning also correlated with the integrity of WM microstructure (high FA and low MD) in an extensive network of tracts including bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, fornix, and long-range tracts.

As most insulin is secreted in the bloodstream by the pancreas, its capacity to regulate brain functions must, at least partly, be mediated through the cerebral vasculature. However, how insulin interacts with the blood-brain barrier and whether alterations of this interaction could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology both remain poorly defined. Here, we show that human and murine cerebral insulin receptors (INSRs), particularly the long isoform INSR\u03b1-B, are concentrated in microvessels rather than in the parenchyma. Vascular concentrations of INSR\u03b1-B were lower in the parietal cortex of subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positively correlating with cognitive scores, leading to a shift towards a higher INSR\u03b1-A/B ratio, consistent with cerebrovascular insulin resistance in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Vascular INSR\u03b1 was inversely correlated with amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, but positively correlated with insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and P-glycoprotein. Using brain cerebral intracarotid perfusion, we found that the transport rate of insulin across the blood-brain barrier remained very low (<0.03\u2005\u00b5l/g\u00b7s) and was not inhibited by an insulin receptor antagonist. However, intracarotid perfusion of insulin induced the phosphorylation of INSR\u03b2 that was restricted to microvessels. Such an activation of vascular insulin receptor was blunted in 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease neuropathology induces insulin resistance at the level of the blood-brain barrier.

Methods: Adu-8D3 and a negative control antibody, based on the HIV specific B12 antibody also carrying C-terminal fused 8D3 scFab (B12-8D3), were each conjugated with NCS-DFO, NCS-DFO*, or TFP-N-suc-DFO-Fe-ester, followed by radiolabeling with 89Zr. 125I was used as a substitute for 124I for labeling of both antibodies. 30 \u00b5g of radiolabeled mAb, corresponding to approximately 6 MBq 89Zr or 2.5 MBq 125I, were injected per mouse.

Autoradiography of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [125I]I-Adu-8D3 showed an amyloid-beta related granular uptake pattern of radioactivity. In contrast, the [89Zr]Zr-DFO-conjugates and the control antibody groups did not show any amyloid-beta related uptake pattern, indicating that DFO is inferior for 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging of the brain in comparison to DFO* for Adu-8D3.

High expression of GDF15 is correlated with worse survival and malignant progression of NSCLC. Knockdown of GDF15 restrained the proliferation, invasion, migration, but accelerated apoptosis of lung cancer cells through regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. sh-GDF15 suppressed epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and promoted the chemotherapy sensitivity of lung cancer cells.

Using in silico analysis of clinically derived platforms, we report a decreased BDP1 expression as a result of deletion in serous ovarian cancer and a correlation with higher and advanced ovarian stages. Further analysis in the context of TP53 mutations, a major contributor to ovarian tumorigenesis, suggests that high BDP1 expression is unfavorable for overall survival and high BDP1 expression occurs in stages 2, 3 and 4 serous ovarian cancer. Additionally, high BDP1 expression is disadvantageous and unfavorable for progression-free survival.

Biodistribution was determined ex vivo using the Pearl fluorescent imager at 72 hours after injection. To mimic a clinical scenario, 2 animals underwent postmortem xenograft resection using both white-light and fluorescence guidance. Lastly, fresh and frozen human meningioma specimens were incubated ex vivo with bevacizumab-IRDye800CW, stained with anti-VEGF\u03b1, and microscopically examined. In vivo, tumors fluoresced at all time points after tracer administration and background fluorescence decreased with time. Ex vivo analyses of tracer biodistribution showed the highest fluorescence in resected tumor tissue. Brain, skull, and muscle tissue showed very low fluorescence. Microscopically, fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm and was correlated with VEGF\u03b1 expression patterns. During postmortem surgery, both the tumor bulk and a small tumor remnant were detected. Bevacizumab-IRDye800CW bound specifically to all tested human meningioma samples, as indicated by a high fluorescent signal in the tumor bulk compared with the surrounding healthy dura mater. Bevacizumab-IRDye800CW showed meningioma specificity, as illustrated by high VEGF\u03b1-mediated uptake in the meningioma xenograft mouse model.

As a result, anti-oxidative stress and attenuating A\u03b2 accumulation might be one promising intervention for AD treatment. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a major component of lipophilic tanshinones in Danshen, is proven to be effective in several diseases, including AD. Due to the poor solubility in water, the clinical application of Tan IIA was limited. Therefore, a great number of nanoparticles were designed to overcome this issue. In the current study, we choose chitson as delivery carrier to load Tanshinone IIA (CS@Tan IIA) and explore the protective effects of CS@Tan IIA on the CL2006 strain, a transgenic C. elegans of AD model organism. Compared with Tan IIA monomer, CS@Tan IIA could significantly prolong the lifespan and attenuate the AD-like symptoms, including reducing paralysis and the A\u03b2 deposition by inhibiting the oxidative stress. The mechanism study showed that the protection of CS@Tan IIA was attenuated by knockdown of daf-16 gene, but not skn-1. The results indicated that DAF-16/SOD-3 pathway was required in the protective effects of CS@Tan IIA. Besides DAF-16/SOD-3 pathway, the Tan IIA-loaded CS nanoparticles might protect the C. elegans against the AD insults via promoting autophagy.

In this study we aimed to generate single domain anti-mouse transferrin receptor antibodies (anti-mTfR VHHs) to mediate BBB transcytosis as components of novel MRI molecular contrast imaging agents. Anti-mTfR VHHs were produced by immunizing a llama with mTfR, generation of a VHH phage display library, immunopanning, and in vitro characterization of candidates. Site directed mutagenesis was used to generate additional variants. VHH fusions with neurotensin (NT) allowed rapid, hypothermia-based screening for VHH-mediated BBB transcytosis in wild-type mice. One anti-mTfR VHH variant was fused with an anti-amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) VHH dimer and labeled with fluorescent dye for direct assessment of in vivo target engagement in a mouse model of AD-related A\u03b2 plaque pathology. An anti-mTfR VHH called M1 and variants had binding affinities to mTfR of <1nM to 1.52nM. The affinity of the VHH binding to mTfR correlated with the efficiency of the VHH-NT induced hypothermia effects after intravenous injection of 600 nmol/kg body weight, ranging from undetectable for nonbinding mutants to -6\u00b0C for the best mutants. The anti-mTfR VHH variant M1P96H with the strongest hypothermia effect was fused to the anti-A\u03b2 VHH dimer and labeled with Alexa647; the dye-labeled VHH fusion construct still bound both mTfR and A\u03b2 plaques at concentrations as low as 0.22 nM. However, after intravenous injection at 600 nmol/kg body weight into APP/PS1 transgenic mice, there was no detectible labeling of plaques above control levels. Thus, NT-induced hypothermia did not correlate with direct target engagement in cortex, likely because the concentration required for NT-induced hypothermia was lower than the concentration required to produce in situ labeling. These findings reveal an important dissociation between NT-induced hypothermia, presumably mediated by hypothalamus, and direct engagement with A\u03b2-plaques in cortex.

Among the many mechanisms involved in the development of vascular cognitive impairment, cerebral small vessel disease is perhaps the most common, contributing to cognitive impairment independent of stroke. An important feature of small vessel disease is its steady progression. The cognitive decline in cerebrovascular disease, including small vessel disease, is also usually gradual and gradual, progresses slowly, and the underlying defect extends to processing speed, complex attention, and fronto-executive functions. Vascular cognitive impairments are quite heterogeneous in nature, while having a negative impact on all major cognitive domains. Patient management should include the earliest possible diagnosis of cognitive impairment and the appointment of timely therapy. One of the drugs that has been successfully used to treat vascular cognitive impairment is nicergoline (Sermion). The clinical efficacy of the drug is achieved due to the improvement of cerebral blood flow, a positive effect on cholinergic neurotransmission and neuroprotective action.

has been associated with neurocognitive performance during chronic infection, but little is known about the early phases. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between blood CD4/CD8 ratio and central nervous system endpoints in primary HIV infection (PHI) before and after antiretroviral treatment (ART). This was a retrospective analysis of the Primary Infection Stage CNS Events Study (PISCES) cohort. We longitudinally assessed blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of inflammation, immune activation and neuronal injury, and neuropsychological testing performance (NPZ4, an average of three motor and one processing speed tests, and a summarized total score, NPZ11, including also executive function, learning and memory) in ART-na\u00efve participants enrolled during PHI. Spearman correlation and linear mixed models assessed the relationships between the trajectory of CD4/CD8 ratio over time and neurocognitive performance, blood and CSF markers of immune activation and neuronal injury. In all, 109 PHI participants were enrolled. The mean CD4/CD8 ratio decreased with longer time from infection to starting treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Every unit increase in NPZ4 score was independently associated with a 0.15 increase in CD4/CD8 ratio (95% CI: 0.002-0.29; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047), whereas no correlation was found between CD4/CD8 ratio and NPZ11. Among the cognitive domains, only a change in processing speed was correlated with CD4/CD8 ratio over time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The trajectory of the CD4/CD8 ratio was negatively correlated with change in CSF neurofilament light chain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

Mounting evidence supported accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) as the primary cause of AD pathology and sprouted a number of candidate treatments engaging A\u03b2 from its production to its clearance, yet no amyloid-based drug candidate had been proven effective. Alternative pathomechanisms have been proposed, but still current treatments are limited to symptomatic therapy. Aducanumab (BIIB-037) is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively binds aggregated forms of A\u03b2, inhibits its template activity and promotes clearance of A\u03b2 deposits. Three early terminated trials in humans are available. Overall, conflicting results exist over measures of clinical efficacy, despite an objective decrease in A\u03b2 burden. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities emerge as the most significant treatment-related adverse event.

Thus, detecting and preventing mild cognitive impairment, which is common in patients with HF, is of great importance. Serum biomarkers are increasingly used in neurological disorders for diagnostics, monitoring, and prognostication of disease course. It remains unclear if neuronal biomarkers may help detect cognitive impairment in this high-risk population. Also, the influence of chronic HF and concomitant renal dysfunction on these biomarkers is not well understood. Within the monocentric Cognition.Matters-HF study, we quantified the serum levels of phosphorylated tau protein 181 (pTau) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) of 146 extensively phenotyped chronic heart failure patients (aged 32 to 85 years; 15.1% women) using ultrasensitive bead-based single-molecule immunoassays. The clinical work-up included advanced cognitive testing and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Serum concentrations of NfL ranged from 5.4 to 215.0 pg/ml (median 26.4 pg/ml) and of pTau from 0.51 to 9.22 pg/ml (median 1.57 pg/ml). We detected mild cognitive impairment (i.e., T-score < 40 in at least one cognitive domain) in 60% of heart failure patients. pTau (p = 0.014), but not NfL, was elevated in this group. Both NfL (\u03c1 = -\u20090.21; p = 0.013) and pTau (\u03c1 = -\u20090.25; p = 0.002) related to the cognitive domain visual/verbal memory, as well as white matter hyperintensity volume and cerebral and hippocampal atrophy. In multivariable analysis, both biomarkers were independently influenced by age (T = 4.6 for pTau; T = 5.9 for NfL) and glomerular filtration rate (T = -\u20092.4 for pTau; T = -\u20093.4 for NfL). Markers of chronic heart failure, left atrial volume index (T = 4.6) and NT-proBNP (T = 2.8), were further cardiological determinants of pTau and NfL, respectively. In addition, pTau was also strongly affected by serum creatine kinase levels (T = 6.5) and ferritin (T = -\u20093.1). pTau and NfL serum levels are strongly influenced by age-dependent renal and cardiac dysfunction.

Global and regional rdcCL scales were compared between MRI-based and CT-based methods. For clinical validation, the cohort consisted of 2245 subjects (627 CN, 933 MCI, and 685 ADD). Both MRI-based and CT-based rdcCL scales showed that FMM and FBB were highly correlated with each other, globally and regionally (R2 = 0.96~0.99). Both FMM and FBB showed that CT-based rdcCL scales were highly correlated with MRI-based rdcCL scales (R2 = 0.97~0.99). Regarding the absolute difference of rdcCLs between FMM and FBB, the CT-based method was not different from the MRI-based method, globally or regionally (p value = 0.07~0.95). In our clinical validation study, the global negative group showed that the regional positive subgroup had worse neuropsychological performance than the regional negative subgroup (p < 0.05). The global positive group also showed that the striatal positive subgroup had worse neuropsychological performance than the striatal negative subgroup (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that it is feasible to convert regional FMM or FBB rdcSUVR values into rdcCL scales without additional MRI scans.

The purpose of our study is to identify multimodal imaging-driven subtypes in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) participants using a multiview learning framework based on Deep Generalized Canonical\u00a0Correlation\u00a0Analysis (DGCCA), to learn shared latent representation with low dimensions from 3 neuroimaging modalities. DGCCA applies non-linear transformation to input views using neural networks and is able to learn correlated\u00a0embeddings with low dimensions that capture more variance than its linear counterpart, generalized CCA (GCCA). We designed experiments to compare DGCCA embeddings with single modality features and GCCA embeddings by generating 2 subtypes from each feature set using unsupervised clustering. In our validation studies, we found that amyloid PET imaging has the most discriminative features compared with structural MRI and FDG PET which DGCCA learns from but not GCCA. DGCCA subtypes show differential measures in 5 cognitive assessments, 6 brain volume measures, and conversion to AD patterns. In addition, DGCCA MCI subtypes confirmed AD genetic markers with strong signals that existing late MCI group did not identify. Overall, DGCCA is able to learn effective low dimensional embeddings from multimodal data by learning non-linear projections. MCI subtypes generated from DGCCA embeddings are different from existing early and late MCI groups and show most similarity with those identified by amyloid PET features. In our validation studies, DGCCA subtypes show distinct patterns in cognitive measures, brain volumes, and are able to identify AD genetic markers.

However, the relationship between lncRNAs and PCGs remains unclear and difficult to predict. Machine learning has achieved a satisfactory performance in association prediction, but to our knowledge, it is currently less used in lncRNA-PCG association prediction. Therefore, we introduce GAE-LGA, a powerful deep learning model with graph autoencoders as components, to recognize potential lncRNA-PCG associations. GAE-LGA jointly explored lncRNA-PCG learning and cross-omics correlation learning for effective lncRNA-PCG association identification. The functional similarity and multi-omics similarity of lncRNAs and PCGs were accumulated and encoded by graph autoencoders to extract feature representations of lncRNAs and PCGs, which were subsequently used for decoding to obtain candidate lncRNA-PCG pairs. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrated that GAE-LGA can successfully capture lncRNA-PCG associations with strong robustness and outperformed other machine learning-based identification methods. Furthermore, multi-omics features were shown to improve the performance of lncRNA-PCG association identification. In conclusion, GAE-LGA can act as an efficient application for lncRNA-PCG association prediction with the following advantages: It fuses multi-omics information into the similarity network, making the feature representation more accurate; it can predict lncRNA-PCG associations for new lncRNAs and identify potential lncRNA-PCG associations with high accuracy.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36308331": {"ArticleTitle": "Utility of Circulating Free DNA Fragmentomics in the Prediction of Pathological Response after Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.", "AbstractText": "A \"Watch and Wait\" (W&W) approach has become an alternative to surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT).

We developed a Markov state-transition model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone among Americans living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD. AD states included MCI due to AD, mild AD, moderate AD, severe AD, and death. A hypothetical DMT was assumed to confer a 30% reduction in progression from MCI and mild AD. The base case annual drug acquisition cost was assumed to be $56,000. Other medical and indirect costs were obtained from published literature or list prices. Utilities for patients and caregivers were obtained from the published literature and varied by AD state and care setting (community care or long-term care). We considered 3 DMT treatment strategies: (1) treatment administered until patients reached severe AD (continuous strategy), (2) treatment administered for a maximum duration of 18 months or when patients reached severe AD (fixed-duration strategy), and (3) 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months because of amyloid plaque clearance and the remaining patients continuing treatment until 18 months or until they reached severe AD (test-and-discontinue strategy). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. From the health care sector perspective, continuous treatment with a hypothetical DMT versus BSC resulted in an ICER of $612,354 per QALY gained. The ICER decreased to $157,288 per QALY gained in the fixed-duration strategy, driven by large reductions in treatment costs. With 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months (test-and-discontinue strategy), the ICER was $125,631 per QALY gained. In sensitivity and scenario analyses, the ICER was the most sensitive to changes in treatment efficacy, treatment cost, and the initial population AD state distribution. From the modified societal perspective, ICERs were 6.3%, 20.4%, and 25.1% lower than those from the health care sector perspective for the continuous, fixed-duration, and test-and-discontinue strategies, respectively.

Untreated tumor-bearing mice and healthy mice were also included as controls. After mycobacterial treatments, the infiltrating immune cell populations in the bladder were analysed by flow cytometry. We provide evidence that mycobacterial treatment triggered a strong immune infiltration into the bladder, with BCG inducing higher global absolute infiltration than M. brumae. The induced global immune microenvironment was strikingly different between the two mycobacterial species, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. Compared with M. brumae, BCG treated mice exhibited a more robust infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells skewed toward an effector memory phenotype, with higher frequencies of NKT cells, neutrophils/gMDSCs and monocytes, especially the inflammatory subset, and higher CD4+ TEM/CD4+ Treg and CD8+ TEM/CD4+ Treg ratios.

Notably, the mycobacterial cell envelope composition in M. brumae had a strong impact on the immune microenvironment, shaping the B and myeloid cell compartment and T-cell maturation profile and thus improving survival. Overall, we demonstrate that the bladder immune microenvironment induced by mycobacterial treatment is species specific and shaped by mycobacterial cell envelope composition.

This study aimed to compare the outcomes of approaches to MALR and determine predictors of long-term treatment failure. The Vascular Low Frequency Disease Consortium (VLFDC) is an international, multi-institutional research consortium. Data on open, laparoscopic, and robotic MALR performed from 2000-2020 were gathered. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as no improvement in MALS symptoms after MALR or recurrence of symptoms between MALR and last clinical follow-up. For 516 patients treated at 24 institutions, open MALR was performed in 227 (44.0%), laparoscopic in 235 (45.5%), and robotic in 54 (10.5%) patients. Perioperative complications (ileus, cardiac, wound complications, readmission, unplanned procedures) occurred in 19.2% (open 30.0% vs. laparoscopic 8.9% vs. robotic 18.5%; p<0.001). Median follow-up was 1.59 years (IQR: 0.38-4.35 years). For the 488 patients with follow-up data, 287 (58.8%) had full relief, 119 (24.4%) had partial relief, and 82 (16.8%) derived no benefit from MALR. The one- and three-year freedom from treatment failure for the overall cohort was 63.8% (95% CI: 59.0%-68.3%) and 51.9% (95% CI: 46.1%-57.3%), respectively. Factors associated with an increased hazard of treatment failure on multivariable analysis included robotic MALR (HR 1.73; 95% CI: 1.16-2.59; p=0.007), a history of gastroparesis (HR 1.83; 95% CI: 1.09-3.09; p=0.023), abdominal cancer (HR 10.3; 95% CI: 3.06-34.6; p<0.001), dysphagia/odynophagia (HR 2.44; 95% CI: 1.27-4.69; p=0.008), no relief from a celiac plexus block (HR 2.18; 95% CI: 1.00-4.72; p=0.049), and increasing number of preoperative pain locations (HR 1.12 per location; 95% CI: 1.00-1.25; p=0.042); factors associated with a lower hazard included increasing age (HR 0.99 per increasing year; 95% CI: 0.98-1.0; p=0.012) and an increasing number of preoperative diagnostic gastrointestinal studies (HR 0.84 per study; 95% CI: 0.74-0.96; p=0.012) Open and laparoscopic MALR had similar long-term freedom from treatment failure. No radiographic parameters were associated with differences in treatment failure. There is no difference in long-term failure after open versus laparoscopic MALR, but open release is associated with higher perioperative morbidity.

These neoplasms are thought to primarily derive from neuroendocrine precursor cells located throughout the body and can also arise through neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of organ-specific epithelial cell types. Hence, NENs constitute a group of tumour types that share key genomic and phenotypic characteristics irrespective of their site of origin, albeit with some organ-specific differences. The establishment of representative preclinical models for several of these disease entities together with analyses of human tumour specimens has provided important insights into crucial aspects of their biology with therapeutic implications. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of NENs of the gastrointestinal system and lung from clinical and biological perspectives. Research on NENs has typically been siloed by the tumour site of origin, and a cross-cutting view might enable advances in one area to accelerate research in others.

The alterations of functionally important m6A sites have been previously shown to play vital roles in tumor initiation and progression, but little is known about the extent to which m6A-regulated genes play in prognostic performance for patients with LUAD. Here, we presented an overview of the m6A methylome in LUAD tissues using transcriptome-wide m6A methylation profiles, and found that differentially methylated transcripts were significantly enriched in tumor-related processes, including immune response, angiogenesis and cell-substrate adhesion. Joint analysis of m6A modification and gene expression suggested that 300 genes were regulated by m6A. Furthermore, we developed a m6A-regulated prognosis-associated signature (m6A-PPS) by performing a multi-step process. The m6A-PPS model, a 15-gene set, was qualified for prognosis prediction for LUAD patients. By regrouping the patients with this model, the OS of the high-risk group was shorter than that of the low-risk group across all datasets.

The aim was to identify key issues and a holistic view of literature regarding positive aspects of caregiving in dementia. A scoping review was conducted underlying a five-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Five databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science, were searched, and references were listed accordingly. Data were extracted by two researchers, comprising article characteristics, forms of positive aspects of caregiving and measurements, theories, forms of dementia and family caregiver, and keywords. Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were performed to analyze data. Network analysis of keywords and authors was conducted using VOSviewer software. Word cloud analysis of titles was examined by NVivo. The review included 230 articles, most of which have been published in the last decade (62.61%). Most articles (40.00%) were contributed by the United States. Cross-sectional studies (41.30%) ranked first, followed by qualitative studies (13.48%). Over a quarter of the literature (28.26%) focused on Alzheimer's care, and nearly 90% included all forms of family caregivers. The Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale and stress coping theory were most frequently cited. Four clusters dominated by Casey D, Quinn C, Joling KJ, and Teahan A were identified in the network of co-authorship. Six themes were identified: current situations of caregiver experiences, antecedents, consequences, measurement development, effects of interventions, and the concept of positive aspects of caregiving. These were in line with network analysis of keywords and word cloud analysis of titles. Positive aspects of caregiving in dementia have been widely concerned, but most of them are based on the theory of the negative stress process and are limited to current situations and influencing factors.

Recently, we have described novel structures in hippocampal area CA1 in aging mice, apparently derived from degenerating presynaptic terminals, that are significantly more prevalent in DPP6-KO mice compared to WT mice of the same age and that these structures were observed earlier in development in DPP6-KO mice. These novel structures appear as clusters of large puncta that colocalize NeuN, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A, and also partially label for MAP2, amyloid \u03b2, APP, \u03b1-synuclein, and phosphorylated tau, with synapsin-1 and VGluT1 labeling on their periphery. In this current study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we confirm that both APP and amyloid \u03b2 are prevalent in these structures; and we show with immunofluorescence the presence of similar structures in humans with Alzheimer's disease. Here we also found evidence that aging DPP6-KO mutants show additional changes related to Alzheimer's disease. We used in vivo MRI to show reduced size of the DPP6-KO brain and hippocampus. Aging DPP6-KO hippocampi contained fewer total neurons and greater neuron death and had diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease present including accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 and APP and increase in expression of hyper-phosphorylated tau. The amyloid \u03b2 and phosphorylated tau pathologies were associated with neuroinflammation characterized by increases in microglia and astrocytes. And levels of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines increased in aging DPP6-KO mice. We finally show that aging DPP6-KO mice display circadian dysfunction, a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease.

In multivariable-adjusted models, living in a neighborhood with a greater ADI (more deprivation) was associated with increased mortality for White patients with breast cancer; compared with the ADI quartile of less than 25 (least deprived), increased mortality HRs were found in quartiles of 25 to 49 (1.22 [95% CI, 1.07-1.39]), 50 to 74 (1.32 [95% CI, 1.13-1.53]), and 75 or greater (1.33 [95% CI, 1.07-1.65]). However, an increase in the ADI quartile group was not associated with changes in mortality for Black patients with breast cancer (quartile 25 to 49: HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.61-1.07]; quartile 50 to 74: HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.70-1.18]; and quartile \u226575: HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.70-1.36]). In neighborhoods with an ADI of 75 or greater, no racial disparity was observed in mortality (HR,\u20091.11 [95% CI, 0.92-1.36]). Black women with breast cancer had higher mortality than White women in Georgia, but this disparity was not explained by ADI: among Black patients, low ADI was not associated with lower mortality.

In this case-control study, we determined selenoprotein P concentrations in both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the serum of 50 individuals diagnosed with ALS, 30 with AD, 54 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and of 30 controls, using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. We found a positive and generally linear association between CSF and serum selenoprotein P concentrations in all groups. CSF selenoprotein P and biomarkers of neurodegeneration were positively associated in AD, while for MCI, we found an inverted-U-shaped relation. CSF selenoprotein P concentrations were higher in AD and MCI than in ALS and controls, while in serum, the highest concentrations were found in MCI and ALS. Logistic and cubic spline regression analyses showed an inverse association between CSF selenoprotein P levels and ALS risk, and a positive association for AD risk, while an inverted-U-shaped relation with MCI risk emerged. Conversely, serum selenoprotein P concentrations were positively associated with risk of all conditions but only in their lower range.

The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a visual assessment method that provides both an overall assessment of brain tauopathy and regional characterization of abnormal tau deposition. Methods: 18-F MK-6240 scans from 102 participants (including healthy volunteers, patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders) were reviewed by an expert nuclear medicine physician blind to participants' diagnosis to identify common patterns of brain uptake. This initial visual read method was field tested in a separate, non-overlapping cohort of 102 participants with 2 additional na\u00efve readers trained on the method. Visual read outcomes were compared with semiquantitative assessments using volume of interest (VOI) SUVr. Results: For the visual read eight gray-matter regions per hemisphere were assessed as negative (no abnormal uptake) or positive (1-25% of the region involved, 25-75% involvement, or >75% involvement), then characterized the tau binding pattern as positive or negative for evidence of tau, and if positive, whether brain uptake is in an AD pattern. Readers demonstrated agreement 94% of the time for overall positivity/negativity.

More importantly, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been observed not only in AD patients, but also in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis in AD is poorly understood. Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is an important pathway for the central nervous system (CNS) regulation of peripheral immune homeostasis, especially in the gut.

According to new evidence, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to aggravate pre-existing inequities, particularly among cancer patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionately negative impact on cancer patients. The unfavorable outcomes in cancer patients who contract COVID-19, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care delivery, and the significant disruption of cancer research are all examples of this consequence. On the other hand, patients with cancer are a diverse group, and new research has identified characteristics that allow for risk categorization of cancer patients to optimize care. Variable access to telemedicine, timely diagnosis, and treatment access are all possible drivers of unequal cancer survival as a result of the epidemic. Despite oncology associations presenting guidelines on cancer care during the pandemic, the magnitude of potential therapy advantages, therapeutic purpose, and access to care all play a role in prioritizing cancer medicines. This review focuses on evidence related to COVID-19 and cancer, such as the molecular interactions between the two diseases and practical therapeutic suggestions for cancer patients during the pandemic.

Overall, 46 patients (10.0%) had incomplete CCRT treatment. Patients in the ANS 2 group experienced a higher rate of incomplete CCRT (20.9%) than those in the ANS 1 (7.4%) and ANS 0 (3.5%) groups. ANS had a better discriminatory ability in predicting CCRT completeness in terms of -2 log-likelihood value, chi-square value, and c-index than the prognostic nutritional index. Patients in the ANS 2 group had significantly higher incidences of grade 3 or higher leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, non-neutropenic infection, and hypokalemia than those in the other two ANS groups.

High-risk (HR) HPV types are a causal factor in cervical cancer. Persistent HPV infection in this subset of immunocompromised women results in faster disease progression. The study determined the prevalence of HPV genotypes in cervicovaginal secretions of HIV seropositive women and the correlation with CD4 counts and cytology. Method: One hundred, non-pregnant, HIV-positive women of 18 years of age and above were enrolled in this cross-sectional study following approval by the institutional ethical committee. A written consent, questionnaire, followed by sample collection including a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear for cytology was undertaken. Cervicovaginal secretion samples were collected in the Digene\u00ae specimen transport medium (STM) (Qiagen Gaithersburg Inc., MD, USA). HPV genotyping was carried out with PCR amplification of a 65-base pair (bp) fragment in the L1 region of the HPV genome using the short PCR fragment (SPF10) primers followed by reverse hybridization by line probe assay (LPA) using the INNOLiPA HPV Genotyping Extra kit (Fujirebio, Belgium). Quantitation of HPV-16 and-18 viral loads (VLs) was done by real-time PCR. Results of Pap smear cytology were correlated with CD4 counts and HPV-16 and-18 VLs. Results: Mean age of the subjects was 34.9 years \u00b1 7.2 years (median 33.0 years, range 24-60 years). HPV was detected in 62 of 93 (66.6%) samples. Twenty (32.25%) of these 62 samples harbored a single HPV genotype. Multiple genotypes (more than two) were detected in 38 (61.3%) samples. HPV-16 was the commonest genotype detected in 26 (27.9%) of all samples and 41.9% of HPV positive samples. Pap smear cytology was reported for 93 women included in the study. Women who had normal cytology were reported as negative for intraepithelial malignancy or lesion (NILM; n = 62; 71.36%), two women had a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL; n = 11), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS; n = 12). Those smears with inadequate material were reported as scant (n = 6). The median CD4 count was 363/cu.mm (range 39-787) in HPV-positive women compared to 423/cu.mm (range 141-996) in those HPV-negative women. Quantitation of HPV-16 and-18 VL was done in duplicate for samples positive by PCR reverse hybridization (INNOLiPA). Of these 20 samples (65%), 12 samples were positive by real-time PCR. The normalized HPV-16 VL ranged between 18 and 240,000 copies/cell. The normalized HPV-18 VL in cervical samples ranged between ~24 and 60,000 copies/cell. Conclusion: HIV-positive women may be infected with multiple genotypes other than HPV-16 and-18. This may have implications on the vaccines available currently which target few specific genotypes only.

We aimed to identify bacteria associated with the progression of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma and determine the contribution of these bacteria to malignant transformation in patients of Han Chinese origin. Microbiota composition was determined through 16S rRNA V3-V4 amplicon sequencing of autologous adenocarcinomas, adenomatous polyps, and non-neoplastic colon tissue samples (referred to as \"tri-part samples\") in patients with CRC. Enriched taxa in adenocarcinoma tissues were identified through pairwise comparison. The abundance of candidate bacteria was quantified through genomic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in tissue samples from 116 patients. Associations of candidate bacteria with clinicopathological features and genomic and genetic alterations were evaluated through odds ratio tests. Additionally, the effects of candidate bacteria on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated through the co-culture of CRC cells with bacterial cells or with conditioned media from bacteria. Prevotella intermedia was overrepresented in adenocarcinomas compared with paired adenomatous polyps. Furthermore, co-abundance of P. intermedia and F. nucleatum was observed in tumor tissues. More notably, the coexistence of these two bacteria in adenocarcinomas was associated with lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. These two bacteria also exerted additive effects on the enhancement of the migration and invasion abilities of CRC cells. Finally, conditioned media from P. intermedia promoted the migration and invasion of CRC cells. This report is the first to demonstrate that P. intermedia is enriched in colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues and enhances the migration and invasion abilities of CRC cells. Moreover, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum exert additive effects on the malignant transformation of colorectal adenomas into carcinomas.

Netie was systematically validated and applied to examine the molecular patterns of 3,219 tumors, compiled from a panel of 18 cancer types.

In TNFi-treated patients, the MSRC had an 88% PPV and 54% sensitivity. MSRC-guided patients were significantly (p<0.0001) more likely to respond to b/tsDMARDs compared with those treated according to standard care (CDAI-LDA/REM: 36.0% vs 21.9%, OR 2.01[1.55-2.60]; CDAI-REM: 10.4% vs 3.6%, OR 3.14 [1.94-5.08]; CDAI-MID: 49.5% vs 32.8%, OR 2.01[1.58-2.55]). : MSRC clinical validity supports high clinical utility: guided treatment selection resulted in significantly superior outcomes relative to standard care; nearly three times more patients reached CDAI remission. Clinicians can offer rheumatoid arthritis patients many types of therapies but the response rate for each of these drugs is low. For example, within the first year of treatment, just about one-half of patients respond to the first-line drug, csDMARD. Only one third of methotrexate-unresponsive patients will respond to the most common second-line agent, a tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 inhibitor. These low response rates present a critical challenge to treating patients. Clinicians try different cs- and b/tsDMARD and fail to quickly identify the most effective options. Then, disease will progress, irreversibly destroying patient joints, diminishing patient health related quality of life, and increasing risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and death. To help clinicians quickly identify the best drugs for patients in a treat-to-target approach, a precision-medicine test was developed to identify patients unlikely to respond to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 inhibitors. This molecular signature response classifier considers both molecular features (patient RNA-expression levels) and clinical features (e.g., body mass index, sex) to predict patient response. To evaluate the effectiveness of this test, the outcomes of patients treated with classifier-selected drugs (in a large, tested cohort) were compared with outcomes of patients treated with conventionally selected therapies (in an external cohort of electronic-health-record data). Patients treated with classifier-selected therapies were approximately three times as likely to achieve remission than were patients treated with conventionally selected drugs. These results suggest that this molecular signature response classifier is a valuable tool for more quickly identifying optimal therapies to treat rheumatoid arthritis.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36154269": {"ArticleTitle": "Potential of fluorescent nanoprobe in diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well known for its insidious nature, slow progression and high incidence as a neurodegenerative disease.

Methods: A series of Erlotinib derivatives (840 compounds) were synthesized using a modular click-chemistry method, and then the thiazolyl blue (MTT) method was used to screen and evaluate the inhibitory effect of these compounds on the growth and metastasis of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Among them, the compound P19G1 showed the best inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the antitumor activity and mechanism of P19G1 were investigated with in vitro cell biology and in vivo assays in an animal model. Results: In vitro pharmacological studies showed that P19G1 had inhibitory effects on a variety of tumor cell lines with IC50 values in the range of 1 to 5 \u03bcM. Moreover, P19G1 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and human colorectal cancer cell line RKO and promoted cell apoptosis. In vivo tumor-bearing mouse model experiments revealed that 50 mg/kg P19G1 effectively inhibited the growth and metastasis of A549 tumors without obvious toxicity to the host. Conclusions: The rapid structural modification of lead compounds using novel modular click-chemistry reactions holds great potential for use in obtaining diverse derivatives for tumor drug screening and development.

Mutations in TFIIH cause the cancer prone DNA-repair disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and the developmental and premature aging disorders trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). 50% of TTD cases are caused by TFIIH mutations. Using TFIIH mutant patient cells from TTD and XP subjects we can show that the stress-sensitivity of the proteome is reduced in TTD, but not in XP. Using three different methods to investigate the accuracy of protein synthesis by the ribosome, we demonstrate that translational fidelity of the ribosomes of TTD, but not XP cells, is decreased. The process of ribosomal synthesis and maturation is affected in TTD cells and can lead to instable ribosomes. Isolated ribosomes from TTD patients show an elevated error rate when challenged with oxidized mRNA, explaining the oxidative hypersensitivity of TTD cells.

Five themes were identified in the qualitative data: hearing diverse perspectives, building connections, collaborating for change, developing research and practice capacity, and leaving recharged. Five themes were identified in the researcher data: impact on development as a researcher, understanding stakeholder needs, informing research design, deepening commitment to rural dementia research, and building a culture of engagement. These findings reflect the key principles and impacts of stakeholder engagement reported in the literature. Additional findings include the value stakeholders place on connecting with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, how the Summit was revitalizing, and how it developed stakeholder capacity to support change in their communities.

The development of AKI portends an increased risk of morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and subsequent development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Given these facts, a multitude of experimental studies have addressed potential methods for inducing AKI prevention in high-risk patients. However, successful clinical translation of promising experimental data has remained elusive. Over the past decade, our laboratory has focused on developing a method for safely triggering AKI protection by inducing \"kidney preconditioning\" in mice by the intravenous administration of a combination of Fe sucrose (FeS)\u2009+\u2009tin protoporphyrin (SnPP). These agents induce mild, but short lived, 'oxidant stress' which synergistically activate a number of kidney 'self-defense' pathways (e.g., Nrf2, ferritin, IL-10). Within 18-24\u2009h of Fe/SnPP administration, marked protection against diverse forms of experimental toxic and ischemic AKI results. FeS/SnPP-mediated reductions in kidney injury can also indirectly decrease injury in other organs by mitigating the so called \"organ cross talk\" phenomenon. Given these promising experimental data, three phase 1b clinical trials were undertaken in healthy subjects and patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD. These studies demonstrated that FeS/SnPP were well tolerated and that they up-regulated the cytoprotective Nrf2, ferritin, and IL-10 pathways. Two subsequent phase 2 trials, conducted in patients undergoing 'on-pump' cardiovascular surgery or in patients hospitalized with COVID 19, confirmed FeS/SnPP safety. Furthermore, interim data analyses revealed statistically significant improvements in several clinical parameters.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are well established as first-choice treatments for VTE in non-cancer patients, offering a more convenient and less invasive treatment option than low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH).

This is further supported by analyses of real-world data in Asian populations demonstrating the efficacy and safety of DOACs in Asian patients with CAT. Apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban are recommended in the most recently updated international guidelines as first-line therapy for CAT in patients without gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers and at low risk of bleeding.

Principals and lead kitchen staff completed surveys to assess determinants of breakfast model adoption. Principals, lead kitchen staff, classroom teachers, climate (i.e., social emotional wellbeing), and facilities staff subsequently participated in interviews to discuss implementation determinants (i.e., facilitators and challenges) and strategies for maximizing student participation. Observations provided rich data to triangulate interviews and survey data.

Presentation of themes was framed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Results highlighted several positive determinants to participation including addressing student and family needs, making data-informed decisions, and providing hot meals and fruit based on student tastes. Negative determinants to implementation comprised challenges to SNAP-Ed-funded policy changes to promote student breakfast participation, lack of communication between administration, and staff and turnover among food service staff. Strategies included modifying school entrance procedures and combining breakfast with other education-related tasks to minimize instructional time lost through breakfast after the bell schedules.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major problem implicated in the etiology of many pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and many others. Proteotoxic stress, here defined as a reduction in bioenergetic activity induced by the accumulation of aberrant proteins in the mitochondria, is likely to be implicated in disease-linked mitochondrial and cellular decline. Various quality control pathways, such as mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR), the ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation of aberrant mitochondrial proteins, and mitochondria-specific autophagy (mitophagy), respond to proteotoxic stress and eliminate defective proteins or dysfunctional mitochondria. This work provides a concise review of mechanisms by which disease-linked aberrant proteins affect mitochondrial function and an overview of mitochondrial quality control pathways that counteract mitochondrial proteotoxicity. We focus on mitochondrial quality control mechanisms relying on the Ub-mediated protein degradation, such as mitochondria-specific autophagy and the mitochondrial arm of the Ub proteasome system (UPS). We highlight the importance of a widening perspective of how these pathways protect mitochondria from proteotoxic stress to better understand mitochondrial proteotoxicity in overlapping pathophysiological pathways.

A photothermally assisted photo-oxygenation treatment based on PCN@ICG could largely enhance the photo-inhibition effect on A\u03b242 aggregation and lead to much lower neurotoxicity upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation at 808 nm compared with a single modality of photo-treatment in both cell-free and in vitro experiments. Generally, local photothermal heat increases the instability of A\u03b2 aggregates and keeps A\u03b2 in the status of monomers, which facilitates the photo-oxygenation process of generating oxidized A\u03b2 monomers with low aggregation capability. In addition, combined with the brain-targeting peptide RVG, the PCN-222@ICG@RVG nanoprobe shows high permeability of the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) on a human brain-on-a-chip platform.

The current study aimed to investigate whether an extract of P. japonicus (named KP-1) protects from microglial cell activation in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the anti-neuroinflammation effects of KP-1, the current study adopted the most widely used experimental models including the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microgliosis in vitro model and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) oligomer (A\u03b2O)-induced neuroinflammation in vivo model, respectively. As a result, KP-1 pre-treatment reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, protein levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in BV2 cells which were significantly promoted by 100 ng ml-1 LPS treatment. Similarly, KP-1 administration protected mice from A\u03b2O-induced memory impairment scored by Y-maze and novel object recognition test (NORT).

Findings were categorized into specific themes that developed. Chemotherapy represented 60.2% of the hospital medication budget. Drug utilization was quantified via monthly consumption documentation and forecasting. However, unreliable data resulted in frequent stockouts (unavailability of the item when it is needed) of chemotherapy with only 67.8% availability. Thirteen healthcare personnel (9 nurses, 2 pharmacists and 2 hospital cleaners) were interviewed: all clinical staff but neither of hospital cleaners believed that they were at risk of hazardous agents. Challenges identified included inadequate and frequent stockouts (unavailability of the item when it is needed) of personal protective equipment, lack of standardized guidelines for chemotherapy handling, admixture, and disposal, lack of designated preparation rooms, and lack of training. All nine nurses handled chemotherapy admixtures despite only two nurses previously receiving in-service training. Most of the participants had never witnessed the disposal of anticancer drugs. Prompted by the results of this study, a dialogue was initiated among members of TASH, the American Cancer Society and the University of North Carolina to implement action-oriented projects to address the gaps identified at TASH. These gaps directly and indirectly affect care and treatment outcomes of patients at a large cancer center.

This study aimed to test whether treatment with losartan (LOS), a selective antagonist of angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R), can prevent or attenuate the acute and long-term radiation-induced damage to testes. Wistar rats were randomly distributed into six groups, three of which were studied on day 2 after irradiation: control (CTRL 2), irradiated non-treated (IR 2), and irradiated and treated with LOS (IRLOS 2); and three other groups that were studied on day 60 after irradiation: control (CTRL 60), irradiated non-treated (IR 60), and irradiated and treated with LOS (IRLOS 60). Seven consecutive days before and on the day of irradiation with 2.5 Gy directly administered in the scrotum, the animals were treated with LOS (34 mg/kg/two times/day). This treatment was continued 2 or 60 days after irradiation. The sperm quality was assessed from epididymis cauda. In addition, the testes were submitted to histopathological and morphometric-stereological analysis as well as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) quantification. Serum FSH and LH and plasma testosterone levels were also determined. The data obtained 2 days after the irradiation showed germ cell apoptosis, formation of vacuoles in the seminiferous epithelium, sloughing of germ cells into the lumen, and retention and phagocytosis of step-19 spermatids in Sertoli basal cytoplasm. The treatment with LOS in this period did not prevent or attenuate a radio-induced damage to the testes, illustrating that this drug does not protect against apoptosis derived from direct effects of radiation. On the other hand, 60 days after exposure, the data evidenced the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation on the testes as decreasing of testicular, epididymal, and seminal vesicle masses; tubular atrophy; reduction of cellular proliferation; and loss of germ cells. LOS was able to prevent some of those deleterious effects, promoting improvements in seminal vesicle mass, sperm vitality, plasma testosterone levels, vacuole number, and cell proliferation. In conclusion, inhibition of the AngII/AT1R axis by LOS is effective in protecting the indirect/delayed radiation damage resulting from oxidative stress established in the tissue.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36233287": {"ArticleTitle": "MOTS-c, the Most Recent Mitochondrial Derived Peptide in Human Aging and Age-Related Diseases.", "AbstractText": "MOTS-c, a 16 amino acid mitochondrial derived peptide, is encoded from the 12S rRNA region of the mitochondrial genome.

Based on comparative studies and meta-analyses, functional and oncological outcomes after both treatment modalities are similar. Historically, radiotherapy (RT) has been performed by irradiation of the whole larynx. However, only the involved vocal cord is being treated with recently introduced hypofractionated concepts that result in 8 to 10-fold smaller target volumes. Retrospective data argues for an improvement in voice quality with non-inferior local control. Based on these findings, single vocal cord irradiation (SVCI) has been implemented as a routine approach in some institutions for ESGC in recent years. However, prospective data directly comparing SVCI with surgery is lacking. The aim of VoiceS is to fill this gap. In this prospective randomized multi-center open-label phase III study with a superiority design, 34 patients with histopathologically confirmed, untreated, unilateral stage 0-I ESGC (unilateral cTis or cT1a) will be randomized to SVCI or transoral CO2-laser microsurgical cordectomy (TLM).

Removal of ubiquitin provides access for enzymatic tau acetylation at lysines 281 and 274. USP11 escapes complete X-inactivation, and female mice and people both exhibit higher USP11 levels than males. Genetic elimination of usp11 in a tauopathy mouse model preferentially protects females from acetylated tau accumulation, tau pathology, and cognitive impairment. USP11 levels also strongly associate positively with tau pathology in females but not males.

Additionally, A\u03b2Os are known to induce autophagy via ROS induction. Previous studies have shown that autophagy upregulation aggravates neuronal cell death. In this study, the effects of peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), a member of the peroxidase family of antioxidant enzymes, on regulating A\u03b2O-mediated autophagy were investigated. Prx2 decreased A\u03b2O-mediated oxidative stress and autophagy in N2a-APPswe cells. Further, we examined the relationship between the neuronal protective effect of Prx2 and a decrease in autophagy. Similar to the effects of N-acetyl cysteine, Prx2 decreased A\u03b2O-induced ROS and inhibited p62 protein expression levels by downregulating the activation of NRF2 and its translocation to the nucleus. In addition, treatment with 3-methyladenine, an autophagy inhibitor, ameliorates neuronal cell death. Overall, these results demonstrate that the Prx2-induced decrease in autophagy was associated with the inhibition of ROS via the ROS-NRF2-p62 pathway in N2a-APPswe cells.

A key question is whether adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded human Tregs can suppress neuroinflammation and amyloid pathology in a preclinical mouse model. An immunodeficient mouse model of AD was generated by backcrossing the 5xFAD onto Rag2 knockout mice (5xFAD-Rag2KO).

Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases for studies published through March 2020 that examined the association between c-Myc expression and clinicopathology or prognosis in HCC patients. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to investigate the prognostic significance of c-Myc expression.

The concept of texture is widely used and essential in many radiomic-based studies. Practice usually reduces spatial multidimensional texture matrices, e.g., gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs), to summary scalar features. These statistical features have been demonstrated to be strongly correlated and tend to contribute redundant information; and does not account for the spatial information hidden in the multivariate texture matrices. This study proposes a novel pipeline to deal with spatial texture features in radiomic studies. A new set of textural features that preserve the spatial information inherent in GLCMs is proposed and used for classification purposes. The set of the new features uses the Wasserstein metric from optimal mass transport theory (OMT) to quantify the spatial similarity between samples within a given label class. In particular, based on a selected subset of texture GLCMs from the training cohort, we propose new representative spatial texture features, which we incorporate into a supervised image classification pipeline. The pipeline relies on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm along with Bayesian optimization and the Wasserstein metric. The selection of the best GLCM references is considered for each classification label and is performed during the training phase of the SVM classifier using a Bayesian optimizer. We assume that sample fitness is defined based on closeness (in the sense of the Wasserstein metric) and high correlation (Spearman's rank sense) with other samples in the same class. Moreover, the newly defined spatial texture features consist of the Wasserstein distance between the optimally selected references and the remaining samples. We assessed the performance of the proposed classification pipeline in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from computed tomographic (CT) images. To evaluate the proposed spatial features' added value, we compared the performance of the proposed classification pipeline with other SVM-based classifiers that account for different texture features, namely: statistical features only, optimized spatial features using Euclidean metric, non-optimized spatial features with Wasserstein metric. The proposed technique, which accounts for the optimized spatial texture feature with Wasserstein metric, shows great potential in classifying new COVID CT images that the algorithm has not seen in the training step.

MEAMs were also positive, except in depression, where as many negative as positive AMs were produced. These findings suggest several underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms of MEAMs, including anxiety reduction, increased fluency, music-evoked emotions, reminiscence, and involuntary retrieval, and that these might be moderated by musical abilities and memory for music. In conclusion, MEAMs appear to be relatively well preserved, especially in AD.

This comorbidity might be due to a pleiotropic effect of genetic variants shared between CD and AD/D. Here, we validated comorbidity of CD and AD/D based on diagnostic records from millions of patients in Korea and the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center (odds ratio 11.5 [8.5-15.5, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)]). By integrating a comprehensive human disease-SNP association database (VARIMED, VARiants Informing MEDicine) and whole-exome sequencing of 50 brains from individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), we identified missense variants in coding regions including APOB, a known risk factor for CD and AD/D, which potentially have a pleiotropic role in both diseases. Of the identified variants, site-directed mutation of ADIPOQ (268\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A; Gly90Ser) in neurons produced abnormal aggregation of tau proteins (p\u2009=\u20090.02), suggesting a functional impact for AD/D. The association of CD and ADIPOQ variants was confirmed based on domain deletion in cardiac cells. Using the UK Biobank including data from over 500000 individuals, we examined a pleiotropic effect of the ADIPOQ variant by comparing CD- and AD/D-associated phenotypic evidence, including cardiac hypertrophy and cognitive degeneration. These results indicate that convergence of health care records and genetic evidences may help to dissect the molecular underpinnings of heart disease and associated cognitive impairment, and could potentially serve a prognostic function.

This is a particular challenge in stroma-rich pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Here, we describe a versatile system to study the impact of tissue architecture on cell phenotype using PDAC as a model system. This fully human system encompassing both primary pancreatic stellate cells and primary organoid cells uses the TRACER platform to allow the creation of user-defined TME architectures that have been inferred from clinical PDAC samples and are analyzed by a CyTOF pipeline to characterize cells extracted from the system. By performing high dimensional characterization using CyTOF, we demonstrate that tissue architecture leads to distinct hypoxia and proliferation gradients. Furthermore, phenotypic markers for both cell types are also graded in ways that cannot be explained by either hypoxia or co-culture alone. This demonstrates the importance of using complex models encompassing cancer cells, stromal cells and allowing control over architecture to explore the impact of tissue architecture on cell phenotype. We anticipate that our model will help decipher how tissue architecture and cell interactions regulate cell phenotype and hence cellular and tissue heterogeneity.

Furthermore, adipocytes in different adipose tissues have different genetic makeup, the cargo contents of the exosomes derived from different adipose tissues under obesity conditions should be different, and hence their impacts on the pathophysiological conditions. iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics show that obesity has more prominent effects on the protein profiles of the exosomes derived from subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT-Exos) in the high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice than those derived from epididymal adipose tissue (EAT-Exos) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT-Exos). The differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in SAT-Exos and VAT-Exos are mainly involved in metabolism. Subsequent untargeted metabolomic and lipidomics analyses reveal that injection of these SAT-Exos into the B6/J-Rab27a-Cas9-KO mice significantly affects the mouse metabolism such as fatty acid metabolism. Some of the DEPs in SAT-Exos are correlated with fatty acid metabolism including ADP-ribosylation factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase-3.

Because of substantial long-term morbidities with chemoradiation and the favorable prognosis of HPV-positive OPC, identifying the optimal deintensification strategy for this group has been a keystone of academic head-and-neck surgery, radiation oncology, and medical oncology for over the past decade. However, the first generation of randomized chemotherapy deintensification trials failed to change the standard of care, triggering concern over the feasibility of de-escalation. National database studies estimate that up to one third of patients receive nonstandard de-escalated treatments, which have subspecialty-specific nuances. A synthesis of the multidisciplinary deintensification data and current treatment standards is important for the oncology community to reinforce best practices and ensure optimal patient outcomes. In this review, the authors present a summary and comparison of prospective HPV-positive OPC de-escalation trials. Chemotherapy attenuation compromises outcomes without reducing toxicity. Limited data comparing transoral robotic surgery (TORS) with radiation raise concern over toxicity and outcomes with TORS. There are promising data to support de-escalating adjuvant therapy after TORS, but consensus on treatment indications is needed. Encouraging radiation deintensification strategies have been reported (upfront dose reduction and induction chemotherapy-based patient selection), but level I evidence is years away.

Although GPCRs are implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), biased GPCR signaling is a largely unexplored area of investigation in AD. Our previous work demonstrated that GPR3-mediated \u03b2-arrestin signaling modulates amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) generation in\u00a0vitro and that Gpr3 deficiency ameliorates A\u03b2 pathology in\u00a0vivo. However, Gpr3-deficient mice display several adverse phenotypes, including elevated anxiety-like behavior, reduced fertility, and memory impairment, which are potentially associated with impaired G protein signaling. Here, we generated a G protein-biased GPR3 mouse model to investigate the physiological and pathophysiological consequences of selective elimination of GPR3-mediated \u03b2-arrestin signaling in\u00a0vivo. In contrast to Gpr3-deficient mice, G protein-biased GPR3 mice do not display elevated anxiety levels, reduced fertility, or cognitive impairment. We further determined that G protein-biased signaling reduces soluble A\u03b2 levels and leads to a decrease in the area and compaction of amyloid plaques in the preclinical App AD mouse model. The changes in amyloid pathology are accompanied by robust microglial and astrocytic hypertrophy, which suggest a protective glial response that may limit amyloid plaque development in G protein-biased GPR3 AD mice.

Increased osmolality resulted in decreased nucleus volume, increased Young's modulus, and increased tumor cell density in ovarian cancer spheroids. Next, we looked at the reversibility of mechanics and morphology after 5\u00a0min of osmotic shock and found that spheroids had a robust ability to return to their original state. Finally, we quantified the size of E-cadherin clusters at cell-cell junctions and observed a significant increase in aggregate size following 30\u00a0min of hypertonic and hypotonic osmotic shocks.

Numerous examples, however, demonstrated that drug efficacy does not always depend only on binding affinity but positively correlates with binding kinetics, that is, the dissociation rate constant (koff). Binding free energy landscape (BFEL) constructor is a computational binding kinetics prediction method, previously developed by us, that estimates the binding kinetics for ligand-protein based on their constructed binding free energy landscape, but it also reveals the detailed molecular mechanism of the binding event, hence, providing the position of transition states at the molecular level to modify/improve the binding kinetics. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a well-known Alzheimer's disease (AD) target for which there is still not an ideal drug on the market. Therefore, to improve the drug design strategy for AD, the binding kinetics and binding molecular mechanisms of the four inhibitors of AChE, that is, E2020 (Aricept), HupA, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine, were studied. Also, the differentiation of the binding kinetics between mAChE and TcAChE was studied to evaluate the sensitiveness of BFEL constructor. The flexibility of molecules has a noticeable effect on the nature of BFEL. To the same target, flexible molecules (i.e., E2020 and Rivastigmine) which contain more rotatable bonds tend to have more complicated BFELs reflecting more complicated molecular action mechanisms than the rigid ones (i.e., HupA and Galantamine), which therefore could be more challenging to be optimized. The binding kinetics is highly dependent on the structure of the molecules, such as the length and the functional groups. Therefore, E2020 presents better binding kinetic and thermodynamic properties with either TcAChE or mAChE. Therefore, it is the most promising lead drug for binding kinetics-based drug design. In addition, the binding kinetics of a drug may present different values in the proteins of different organisms because the residue compositions of the binding gorges of the targets are variant, that is, E2020 shows lower binding affinity and association energy barrier in binding with mAChE than TcAChE.

In this systematic review, we summarize findings on structural and functional brain connectivity in DLB, as connectivity measures may offer better insights on how the brain is affected by the spread of the pathology. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, and SCOPUS for relevant articles published up to November 1, 2021. Of 1215 identified records, we selected and systematically reviewed 53 articles that compared connectivity features between patients with DLB and healthy controls. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-positron emission computer tomography, and electroencephalography assessments of patients revealed widespread abnormalities within and across brain networks in DLB. Frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks and their connections to other brain regions featured the most consistent disruptions, which were also associated with core clinical features and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, graph theoretical measures revealed disease-related decreases in local and global network efficiency. This systematic review shows that structural and functional connectivity characteristics in DLB may be particularly valuable at early stages, before overt brain atrophy can be observed. This knowledge may help improve the diagnosis and prognosis in DLB as well as pinpoint targets for future disease-modifying treatments. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

However, the role and mechanism of bone marrow MSC- (BMSC-) derived CX3CL1 in AD remains elusive. In this study, A\u03b2 1-42-intervened SH-SY5Y cells were used for AD cell model construction. pcDNA-ligated CX3CL1 overexpression plasmids were transfected into BMSCs. The levels of soluble and membrane-bound CX3CL1 were detected by ELISA and Western blotting (WB), respectively. The growth, apoptosis, and pathology of AD model cells were evaluated by CCK-8, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, morphology observation, biochemical examination, and WB. It was found that A\u03b2 1-42 significantly reduced CX3CL1 expression either in soluble or membrane-bound form, cell viability, relative protein expression of synaptic markers, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px contents, as well as Trx protein expression; in addition, it enhanced the apoptosis rate, the relative expression of cleaved caspase-3, A\u03b2, tau, p-Tau, Iba1, MDA, TXNIP, and NLRP3 in SH-SY5Y cells; however, the above effects were prominently reversed by the coculture of BMSCs.

Mutations in the kelch13 (k13) gene (for example, those resulting in the Cys580Tyr [C580Y] variant) were identified as genetic markers for ART-resistant parasites, which suggests they are associated with resistance mechanisms. However, not all resistant parasites contain a k13 mutation, and clearly greater understanding of resistance mechanisms is required. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) found single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ART-resistance in fd (ferredoxin), arps10 (apicoplast ribosomal protein S10), mdr2 (multidrug resistance protein 2), and crt (chloroquine resistance transporter), in addition to k13 gene mutations, suggesting that these alleles contribute to the resistance phenotype. The importance of the FD and ARPS10 variants in ART resistance was then studied since both proteins likely function in the apicoplast, which is a location distinct from that of K13. The reported mutations were introduced, together with a mutation to produce the k13-C580Y variant into the ART-sensitive 3D7 parasite line and the effect on ART-susceptibility using the 0-3\u00a0h ring survival assay (RSA0-3\u00a0h) was investigated. Introducing both fd-D193Y and arps10-V127M into a k13-C580Y-containing parasite, but not a wild-type k13 parasite, increased survival of the parasite in the RSA0-3\u00a0h.

Finally, the potential ability of tested compounds to cross the BBB was evaluated by computational studies. Molecular docking was performed with the TLR4/MD-2 complex to assess the possibility of binding the tested compounds in the LPS binding pocket. Prediction of ADMET parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) was also conducted. The unfavorable effect of LPS and co-culture with THP-1 cells on neuronal cell viability was counteracted with TP1 and TP4 in all tested concentrations. Tested compounds reduced the oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by both LPS and microglia activation and also reduced DNA damage. Furthermore, new derivatives inhibited total COX activity. Additionally, new compounds would cross the BBB with high probability and reach concentrations in the brain not lower than in the serum. The binding affinity at the TLR4/MD-2 complex binding site of TP4 and TP8 compounds is similar to that of the drug donepezil used in Alzheimer's disease.

The few preclinical studies on this topic have only compared two subtypes of one antibody each and have yielded conflicting results. We selected two single domain antibodies (sdAbs) derived from a llama immunized with tau proteins and utilized them to generate an array of Fc-(sdAb)2 subclasses containing identical tau binding domains but differing Fc region. Unmodified sdAbs and their IgG subclasses were tested for efficacy in primary cultures and in vivo microdialysis using JNPL3 tauopathy mice. Unmodified sdAbs were non-toxic, blocked tau toxicity and promoted tau clearance. However, the efficacy/safety profile of their Fc-(sdAb)2 subclasses varied greatly within and between sdAbs. For one of them, all its subtypes were non-toxic, only those with effector function cleared tau, and were more effective in vivo than unmodified sdAb.

Here, we investigate the transcriptional mechanisms by which Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3), a transcriptional regulator that promotes healthy aging, affects GSC function and the extent to which FOXO3 transcriptional networks are dysregulated in aging and GBM. We performed transcriptome analysis of clinical GBM tumors and observed that high FOXO3 activity is associated with gene expression signatures of stem cell quiescence, reduced oxidative metabolism, and improved patient outcomes. Consistent with these findings, we show that elevated FOXO3 activity significantly reduces the proliferation of GBM-derived GSCs. Using RNA-seq, we find that functional ablation of FOXO3 in GSCs rewires the transcriptional circuitry associated with metabolism, epigenetic stability, quiescence, and differentiation. Since FOXO3 has been implicated in healthy aging, we then investigated the extent to which it regulates common transcriptional programs in aging neural stem cells (NSCs) and GSCs. We uncover a shared transcriptional program and, most strikingly, find that FOXO3-regulated pathways are associated with altered mitochondrial functions in both aging and GBM.

Here, the gut barrier function was investigated in pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia mouse models by relating intestinal permeability to the degree of cachexia. We further investigated the involvement of the gut-brain axis and the crosstalk between tumour, gut and hypothalamus in vitro. Two distinct mouse models of pancreatic cancer cachexia (KPC and 4662) were used. Intestinal inflammation and permeability were assessed through fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and hypothalamic and systemic inflammation through mRNA expression and plasma cytokines, respectively. To simulate the tumour-gut-brain crosstalk, hypothalamic (HypoE-N46) cells were incubated with cachexia-inducing tumour secretomes and LPS. A synthetic mimic of C26 secretome was produced based on its secreted inflammatory mediators. Each component of the mimic was systematically omitted to narrow down the key mediator(s) with an amplifying inflammation. To substantiate its contribution, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor was used. In vivo experiments showed FITC-dextran was enhanced in the KPC group (362.3 vs. sham 111.4\u00a0ng/mL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). LPS was increased to 140.9\u00a0ng/mL in the KPC group, compared with sham and 4662 groups (115.8 and 115.8\u00a0ng/mL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Hypothalamic inflammatory gene expression of Ccl2 was up-regulated in the KPC group (6.3 vs. sham 1, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, 4662 1.3, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), which significantly correlated with LPS concentration (r\u00a0=\u00a00.4948, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0226). These data suggest that intestinal permeability is positively related to the cachexic degree. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was confirmed to be present in the plasma and PGE2 concentration (log10) in the KPC group was much higher than in 4662 group (1.85 and 0.56\u00a0ng/mL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), indicating a role for PGE2 in pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia. Parallel to in vivo findings, in vitro experiments revealed that the cachexia-inducing tumour secretomes (C26, LLC, KPC and 4662) amplified LPS-induced hypothalamic IL-6 secretion (419%, 321%, 294%, 160%). COX-2 inhibitor to the tumour cells reduced PGE2 content (from 105 to 102 \u00a0pg/mL) in the secretomes and eliminated the amplified hypothalamic IL-6 production. Moreover, results could be reproduced by addition of PGE2 alone, indicating that the increased hypothalamic inflammation is directly related to the PGE2 from tumour. PGE2 secreted by the tumour may play a role in amplifying the effects of bacteria-derived LPS on the inflammatory hypothalamic response. The cachexia-inducing potential of tumour mice models parallels the loss of intestinal barrier function. Tumour-derived PGE2 might play a key role in cancer-related cachexia-anorexia syndrome via tumour-gut-brain crosstalk.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36076399": {"ArticleTitle": "Black mulberry (Morus nigra) fruit extract alleviated AD-Like symptoms induced by toxic A\u03b2 protein in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans via insulin DAF-16 signaling pathway.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most severe neurodegenerative disorders.

Core needle biopsies used for this purpose often under-grade the tumour. The grade obtained from fine needle aspiration cytology samples will help in such situations and whenever biopsy is not done, as in a resource-poor setup. Many studies are being done to find out the cytological grading system that correlates well with histological grading. Methods This study was done between 2016 and 2019 including the cases in which both modified radical mastectomy and fine needle aspiration of the tumour had been done. Robinson's cytological grading was done in Papanicolaou and haematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained cytology smears and correlated with modified Bloom-Richardson histologic grading done in modified radical mastectomy specimens. We also studied the prognostic significance of Robinson's method by studying the association between cytological grade and lymph node metastasis. Results Sixty cases were studied. The two methods had the same grade in 49 (81.7%) cases. They showed a significant positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.848, p-0.0001), significant association (Chi-square test, p-0.0001), and substantial agreement (kappa value 0.72). Multiple regression analysis showed chromatin score and nucleoli score as the most influential parameters. Lymph node metastasis showed significant association with cytological grade (p-0.0003), cell dissociation score (p-0.0001), nucleoli score (p-0.01), and chromatin score (p-0.04). Conclusion Robinson's cytological grading is a simple, reliable adjunct/alternative to core needle biopsies for grading breast carcinomas before mastectomy.

Herein, a novel DNAzyme walkers-triggered CRISPR-Cas12a/Cas13a strategy was proposed for the synchronous determination of exosomal proteins: serum amyloid A-1 protein (SAA1) and coagulation factor V (FV). In this design, the paired antibodies were used to recognize targets, thereby ensuring the specificity. DNAzyme walkers were employed to convert the contents of SAA1 and FV into activators (P1 and P2), and one target can produce abundant activators, thus achieving an initial amplification of signal. Furthermore, the P1 and P2 can activate CRISPR-Cas12a/Cas13a system, which in turn trans-cleaves the reporters, enabling a second amplification and generating two fluorescent signals. The assay is highly sensitive (limits of detection as low as 30.00\u00a0pg/mL for SAA1 and 200.00\u00a0pg/mL for FV), highly specific and ideally accurate. More importantly, it is universal and can be used to detect both non-membrane and membrane proteins in exosome. Besides, the method can be successfully applied to detect SAA1 and FV in plasma exosomes to differentiate between lung cancer patients and healthy individuals. To explore the application of the developed method in tumor diagnosis, a deep learning model based on the expressions of SAA1 and FV was developed. The accuracy of this model can achieve 86.96%, which proves that it has a promising practical application capacity.

Blood p181-tau was the best blood biomarker to identify amyloid-PET positivity (AUC=0.74 [95%CI=0.69-0.79]). Higher blood and CSF p181-tau and NfL concentrations were associated with accelerated time to AD dementia onset with similar incidence rates, whereas blood A\u03b242/40 was less efficient than CSF A\u03b242/40. Blood p181-tau alone was the best blood predictor of 5-year AD/mixed dementia risk (c-index=0.73 [95%CI=0.69-0.77]); its accuracy was higher in patients with CDR=0 (c-index=0.83 [95% CI=0.69;0.97]) than in patients with CDR=0.5 (c-index=0.70 [95% CI=0.66;0.74]).

However, the role of USP36 in breast cancer is unknown. We analyzed the expression of USP36 in breast cancer and its association with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The effect of USP36 on malignant biological behavior of breast cancer was verified by cell functional experiments. The upstream regulatory mechanism of USP36 was analyzed by Western blot and quantitative RT-qPCR. The influence of USP36 on the Warburg effect of breast cancer was analyzed by detecting the metabolism of cellular energy substances. We found that USP36 is highly expressed in breast tumor tissues and breast cancer cell lines. High expression of USP36 predicts poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Effectively reducing the expression of USP36 can significantly inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells, and promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, inhibiting the expression of USP36 can significantly inhibit the production of ATP, lactate, pyruvate and glucose uptake in breast cancer cells. miR-140-3p is an upstream regulator of USP36, which can partially reverse the regulatory effect of USP36 on breast cancer cells. Importantly, USP36 regulates the expression of PKM2 through ubiquitination, which plays a role in regulating the Warburg effect.

In this study, we have found that mGluR-LTD is enhanced in the APPswe /PS1dE9 mouse at 7 but returns to wild-type levels at 13\u2009months of age. This transient over-activation of mGluR signalling is coupled with impaired LTP and shifts the dynamic range of synapses towards depression. These alterations in synaptic plasticity are associated with an inability to utilize cues in a spatial learning task. The transient dysregulation of plasticity can be prevented by genetic deletion of the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a substrate of p38 MAPK, demonstrating that manipulating the mGluR-p38 MAPK-MK2 cascade at 7\u00a0months can prevent the shift in synapse dynamic range.

However, although there is some evidence on the effects of aerobic training on oxidative stress, there is little information regarding the effects of multicomponent exercise (dual-task training) and combination of exercise with cognitive stimulation on oxidative stress. In this context, the aim of this study was to verify the effects of a multicomponent exercise program on physical fitness and cognitive function in the elderly with mild cognitive impairment and determine the role of oxidative stress and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). At baseline, 37 elderly nursing home residents with mild cognitive impairment were divided into two groups: the control group (CG, n = 12, 81.8 years) and the experimental group (EG, n = 25, 83.2 years). These elderlies followed multicomponent exercise training for 24 weeks, with two sessions per week and 45-50 min per session. The exercises included both aerobic and strength exercises, considering functional movements and light to moderate intensity. Cognitive stimulation comprehended exercises based on word games, puzzles, mathematical calculations, forward and backward counting, computer exercises, exergames, and games on a balanced platform. Physical assessments (weight, height, and body mass index), health and functional parameters (fitness tests: chair stand, arm curls, chair sit-and-reach, eight feet up-and-go, back scratch, 6-min walking, feet together, semi-tandem, and full tandem), lipid profile (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides), measures of lipid peroxidation damage, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and BDNF were measured in plasma, based on which analyses were performed before and after the 24 weeks of the multicomponent exercise intervention.

The results indicated that the key interactions found in both donepezil and the selected hybrid donepezils were the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction to Trp86 in the catalytic anionic site (CAS) and Trp286 and Tyr341 in the peripheral anionic site (PAS) in the AChE binding pocket. Moreover, the modification of the scaffolds revealed the adaptation of the orientation in the binding pocket and additional important interactions from the modified scaffold, such as H-bond and H-\u03c0 interactions to Asp74, Tyr124 and Tyr337. In addition, the HOMO-LUMO prediction indicated the binding interaction by considering the electron transfer between the hybrid donepezils and key residues, such as Trp86 and Trp286.

However, the relationship between selective autophagy and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the interaction between p62, an adapter protein, and an APP-related molecule, and found that p62 interacted with the C-terminal fragment of APP (C60). When C60 and p62 are overexpressed, aggregates are formed, and C60 is degraded by autophagy. These aggregates cannot be easily degraded, even with a reducing agent. We also found that autophagosome- and lysosome-marker-positive vesicles were formed in the C60- and p62-expressing cells. Super resolution technology also revealed that p62-C60-positive autophagosomes were formed in the cells.

Our results have shown that the m6A demethylase FTO was up-regulated in human primary and 5-FU resistant CRC. Depletion of FTO decreased cell growth, colony formation and metastasis in 5-FU resistant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified SIVA1, a critical apoptotic gene, as a key downstream target of the FTO-mediated m6A demethylation. The m6A demethylation of SIVA1 at the CDS region induced its mRNA degradation via a YTHDF2-dependent mechanism. The SIVA1 levels were negatively correlated with the FTO levels in clinical CRC tissues. Notably, inhibition of FTO significantly reduced the tolerance of 5-FU in 5-FU-resistant CRC cells via the FTO-SIVA1 axis, whereas SIVA1-depletion could restore the m6A-dependent 5-FU sensitivity in CRC cells.

We applied the platform to analyze the secretion profiles from paired neuron-macrophage and neuron-microglia single cells with human cell lines. We found that pairwise neuron-macrophage interaction would trigger immune responses and attenuate neuron cells' secretion, while neuron-microglia interaction generally results in opposite outcomes in secretion. When neuron cells are induced with A\u03b21-42 protein into the AD model, both neuron-macrophage and neuron-microglia interactions lead to increased cytokines and NDEs and decreased NFs. Further analysis of AD patients' serum showed that NDEs were significantly higher in patients' samples than in the control group, validating our observation from the interaction assay. Furthermore, we resolved previously undifferentiated heterogeneity underlying the secretions from single-neuron cells. We found that the NDE and NF secretion was less dependent on the paracrine signaling between one another and that secretions from neuron cells would attenuate after differentiation with A\u03b21-42.

Here, we investigated the prognostic value of INHBA and its correlation with tumor-infiltration immune cells in the microenvironment of breast cancer. Methods: In this study, we analyzed the INHBA expression profile in the Oncomine database and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER2.0) site. Using Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner (bc-GenExMiner v4.7) tool and the UALCAN cancer database, we further evaluated the correlation of INHBA expression with clinicopathological factors in breast cancer.

In addition, correlations between INHBA expression and gene markers of immune infiltrates were analyzed by TIMER2.0 and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2. Results: Compared with the level in normal tissues, the INHBA mRNA expression was upregulated in different subtypes of breast cancer, and its expression was positively correlated with progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status, and PAM50 subtypes but negatively related to age and basal-like status. The INHBA protein was also highly expressed in primary breast cancer and closely related to the pathological stage. Patients with high INHBA expression levels showed worse overall survival, relapse-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival. Also, high INHBA expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival and relapse-free survival in positive lymph nodes. Of interest, INHBA expression was negatively correlated with infiltrating levels of activated NK cells, NKT, and CD4+ T cells but was positively correlated with tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, especially macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Moreover, INHBA expression showed strong correlations with various markers of monocytes/macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts.

While DCLK1's regulatory effect on the tumor immune microenvironment has been hypothesized, its mode of action has not previously been demonstrated in vivo, which hampers the potential intervention based on this molecule for clinical practice. To define the immunomodulatory mechanisms of DCLK1 in vivo, we generated the DCLK1-/- tumor cells by CRIPSR-Cas9 and developed subcutaneous and intestinal orthotopic transplantation tumor models. Tumor tissues were harvested and subjected to immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry analysis of tumor infiltrating immune cell populations, tumor myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) sorting by isolation kit and then co-culture with spleen T cells, and RNA-sequencing for transcriptomic analysis. We found DCLK1-/- tumor cells lose their tumorigenicity under immune surveillance. Failed tumor establishment of DCLK1-/- was associated with an increase in infiltration of CD8+ T cells and effector CD4+ T cells, and reduced numbers of MDSCs in the tumor tissue. Furthermore, DCLK1 promoted the upregulation of CXCL1, which recruits MDSCs in CRC through CXCR2. The ability of in vivo tumor growth of DCLK1-/- tumor cells was rescued by CXCL1 overexpression.

Our synthetic approach yields chemically stabilized tertiary domain mimetics that cooperatively bind the MYC/MAX consensus E-box motif with nanomolar affinity, exhibit specificity that is equivalent to or beyond that of full-length TFs and directly compete with MYC/MAX protein for DNA binding. A lead STR directly inhibits MYC binding in cells, downregulates MYC-dependent expression programs at the proteome level and inhibits MYC-dependent cell proliferation. Co-crystallization and structure determination of a STR:E-box DNA complex confirms retention of DNA recognition in a near identical manner as full-length bHLH TFs.

However, its antitumor effect and mechanism are not clear. The antitumor effect of CAG was investigated in MC38 and CT26 mouse transplanted tumor models. The antitumor effect of CAG was further analyzed via single-cell multiomics sequencing. Target responsive accessibility profiling technology was used to find the target protein of CAG. Subsequently, the antitumor mechanism of CAG was explored using confocal microscopy, coimmunoprecipitation and transfection of mutant plasmids. Finally, the combined antitumor effect of CAG and PD-1 antibodies in mice or organoids were investigated. We found that CAG effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Our single-cell multiomics atlas demonstrated that CAG promoted the presentation of tumor cell-surface antigens and was characterized by the enhanced killing function of CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, CAG bound to its target protein cathepsin B, which then inhibited the lysosomal degradation of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) and promoted the aggregation of MHC-I to the cell membrane, boosting the presentation of the tumor antigen.

Melanoma metastasis hinges on the bidirectional cell-cell communication within the complex metastatic microenvironments (MME). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are recognized as a new class of molecular mediator in MME programing. Published studies show that melanoma EVs can educate MME stromal cells to acquire the pro-metastatic phenotype to enhance metastatic colonization. Whether EVs can mediate the interactions between heterogenous cancer cells within the MME that alter the course of metastasis has not been investigated at the mechanistic level. In this study, melanoma parental cells (MPCs) and paired derivative cancer stem cell line melanoma stem cells (MSCs) that were derived from melanoma cell line M14 were used. We demonstrate that the EVs-mediated crosstalk between the MSCs and the MPCs is a novel mechanism for melanoma metastasis. We characterized miR-592, a relatively novel microRNA of prognostic potential, in mediation of such intercellular crosstalk. EVs can encapsulate and deliver miR-592 to target MPCs. Upon entering, miR-592 inhibits the expression of its gene target protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type7 (PTPN7), a phosphatase targeting MAPKs. This leads to the relief of the inhibitory effect of PTPN7 on MAPK/ERK signaling and consequently the augmentation of metastatic colonization of MPCs.

Therefore, in this study, we designed three stable ternary co-amorphous systems to improve the physicochemical properties of the binary co-amorphous system of AP-OMT. The ternary co-amorphous systems were prepared with AP, OMT, and trans-cinnamic acid (CA), p-hydroxycinnamic acid (pHCA), or ferulic acid (FA).

Solubility studies showed that the solubility of the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA was significantly increased compared with that of crystalline AP. Dissolution experiments suggested that the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA exhibited better dissolution behavior without significant recrystallization compared to the binary co-amorphous AP-OMT. The stability study confirmed that the ternary co-amorphous system of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA maintained good physical stability in the long term for 18 months.

What should the elderly and people with dementia do and how the society should accommodate these special groups have aroused heated discussions in the society. The goal of the medical-nursing integration model is to realize the integrated model of medical care-nursing-rehabilitation-old care, and to better satisfy the needs by providing medical services, rehabilitation care, and health management. The medical needs of the elderly can help the elderly maintain a healthy state; the elderly care needs can be better met through elderly care services, and the burden on families and society can be reduced. With the advancement of the medical-care integration model, new solutions have been provided for the management of senile dementia patients. Therefore, under the medical-care integration model, this paper managed Alzheimer's patients based on the big data algorithm based on association rules and compared it with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, and drew the following conclusions: compared with the management satisfaction of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, family members and patients' total satisfaction with nursing management under the medical-care integration model was greatly improved; compared with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, the incidence of adverse events in the management of Alzheimer's patients under the medical-care integration model was greatly reduced, which was reduced to 17.6%; under the medical-care integration model, the anxiety and depression scores of the elderly patients with dementia decreased rapidly; under the medical-care integration model, the living ability of senile dementia patients has been greatly improved; the use of the medical-care integration model to manage senile dementia patients has greatly improved the sleep quality, mental quality, and quality of life of senile dementia patients.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36281662": {"ArticleTitle": "The role of A\u03b2 in Alzheimer's Disease as an Evolutionary Outcome of Optimized Innate Immune Defense.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive manifestation of aging associated with accumulated Amyloid \u03b2. It remains frustratingly unclear why this protein accumulates and how it contributes to Alzheimer's Disease pathology. In one recent hypothesis, Amyloid \u03b2 is suggested to function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immune defense within the brain, where Amyloid \u03b2 gains toxicity when it becomes abundant. This essay proposes an evolutionary explanation for why Amyloid \u03b2 expression is regulated at an optimum based on its function as a defense and how this leads to disease. Among its potential physiological functions, Amyloid \u03b2 confers benefits to reduce direct pathogen damage while this simultaneously entails cellular cost of defense. Optimal Amyloid \u03b2 expression occurs when the gain in fitness from an incremental increase is balanced by the marginal cost of this increase. It proposes that natural selection acting upon the young favored systems to maintain Amyloid \u03b2 at an optimal level through mechanisms that induce the defense and repress its expression. With age, the force of natural selection declines and permits mechanisms of negative feedback repression to degenerate. Consequently, Amyloid \u03b2 is expressed beyond its optimum. Age also elevates cumulative pathogen exposure, reduces pathogen barriers and reactivates latent pathogens. The net effect is elevated, chronic induction of Amyloid \u03b2 in the brain. The model recommends attention to innate immune negative regulation in the brain to discover ways to restore these functions toward a youthful state in the elderly.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36280370": {"ArticleTitle": "[Physical activity in the elderly with other major neurocognitive disorders].", "AbstractText": "For decades, the literature was skeptical about the feasibility of motor rehabilitation and its impact, as well as that of physical activity (PA), in subjects with major neurocognitive disorders (MNCD), including Alzheimer's disease.

It is the most common type of dementia in the aging population. Although many anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) drugs are already available on the market, their performance sometimes yields unexpected results. For this reason, research works are ongoing to find potential anti-AChE agents both from natural and synthetic sources. In this study, 90 extracts from 30 native and naturalized medicinal plants are tested by TLC and Ellman's colorimetric assay at 250, 125 and 62.5 \u03bcg/mL in order to determine the inhibitory effect on AChE. In total, 21 out of 90 extracts show high anti-AChE activity (75-100% inhibition) in a dose-dependent manner. Among them, ethanolic extract from aerial parts of O. vulgare ssp. vulgare shows an IC50 value 7.7 times lower than galantamine. This research also establishes the chemical profile of oregano extract by TLC, HPLC-DAD and LC-MS, and twenty-three compounds are identified and quantified. Dihydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids are the most abundant ones (56.90 and 25.94%, respectively). Finally, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties are quantified by colorimetric methods. The total phenolic content is 207.64 \u00b1 0.69 \u00b5g/mg of extract.

We aimed to investigate molecular mechanisms of medulloblastoma invasion in the current work. Methods: The gene expression profile of medulloblastoma were analyzed based on the data deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and filtered according to brain specific proteins in the Uniprot. Delta-catenin was identified and further analyzed about its expression and roles in the prognosis of medulloblastoma patient. The function of delta-catenin on cell invasion and migration were investigated by transwell and wound healing assay. Whether delta-catenin participates in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated invasion was also studied. Results: Delta-catenin expression was highly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues from medulloblastoma patients in five independent, nonoverlapping cohorts. Furthermore, delta-catenin expression level was upregulated in WNT subgroup, and significantly correlated with better prognosis, and associated with metastasis through GEO database analysis. Functional assays indicated that delta-catenin inhibited medulloblastoma cell invasion and migration through regulating the key factors of EMT pathway, such as E-cadherin and vimentin.

The findings revealed that 7-Epitaxol exerts cytotoxic effects in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Specifically, 7-Epitaxol increased Fas, TNF-R1, DR5, DcR3 and DcR2 expressions, reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic proteins) expressions, and increased Bid and Bim L/S (pre-apoptotic proteins) expressions, leading to activation of caspase-mediated cancer cell apoptosis. At the upstream cell signalling level, 7-Epitaxol reduced the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and p38 to trigger apoptosis. In vivo results showed that animals treated with 7-Epitaxol show antitumor growth compared to control animals.

Several lines of evidence suggest that neurodegenerative processes are involved here. We are investigating whether autoantibody-positive psychiatric syndromes differ from those that are autoantibody-negative in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurodegeneration markers. We retrospectively analyzed data from 167 psychiatric patients at the University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen from 2017 to 2020. We divided this patient cohort into two, namely antibody-positive and antibody-negative. We compared various clinical features, neurodegeneration markers, and their autoantibody status in CSF and serum. We then compared both cohorts' neurodegeneration markers to a representative Alzheimer cohort. We subdivided the patients into their diverse psychiatric syndromes according to the manual to assess and document psychopathology in psychiatry (the AMDP), and compared the neurodegeneration markers. Antibody-associated psychiatric syndromes do not appear to reveal significantly greater neurodegeneration than their antibody-negative psychiatric syndromes. 71% of antibody-positive patients fulfilled the criteria for a possible and 22% for a definitive autoimmune encephalitis. Our autoantibody-positive patient cohort's relative risk to develop an possible autoimmune encephalitis was 9%. We also noted that phosphorylated tau protein 181 (ptau 181) did not significantly differ between antibody-associated psychiatric syndromes and our Alzheimer cohort. The psycho-organic syndrome usually exhibits the most prominent neurodegeneration markers, both in antibody-positive and antibody-negative psychiatric patients. We did not find hints for neurodegenerative processes in our antibody-positive versus AD cohort considering total tau or amyloid markers. However, our findings indicate that the neurodegeneration marker ptau181 does not differ significantly between antibody-positive and Alzheimer cohorts, further suggesting axonal neurodegeneration in antibody-positive patients as AD patients have an elevated ptau181.

Comparing HCEG to LCEG, we attained four signatures according to the sex of patients, in order to identify the healthy and AD brain cellular architecture, performing a genomic deconvolution analysis. We used neurological signatures (NS) belonging to six neurological cells populations and nine signatures that included the main physiological neurological processes. We discovered that, in the brains of NDHC the high expression levels of CHI3L1 were associated with astrocyte activation profile, while in AD males and females we showed an inflammatory profile microglia-mediated. The low CHI3L1 brain expression levels in NDHC and AD patients highlighted a neuronal activation profile.

Therefore, it is indispensable to design a detection tool for selective and rapid response toward BChE. In this study, we developed a novel near-infrared fluorescent probe (Chy-1) for the detection of BChE activity. An excellent sensitivity, good biocompatibility, and lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.12 ng/mL made the probe extremely specific for BChE, which was successfully used in biological imaging. What is more, Chy-1 can not only clearly distinguish tumor from normal cells but also forms a clear boundary between the normal and cancer tissues due to the obvious difference in fluorescence intensity produced via in situ spraying. Most important of all, Chy-1 was also successfully applied to track the BChE activity in AD mouse models.

Following growth factor treatment, in cells that divide both ERK and Akt activities are significantly higher within the S-G2 time window (~\u20098.5-40\u00a0h).

Simple metrics of central tendency in this time window are associated with subsequent cell division fates. ERK activity was more strongly associated with division fates than Akt activity, suggesting Akt activity dynamics may contribute less to the decision driving cell division in this context. We also find that ERK and Akt activities are less correlated with each other in cells that divide. Network reconstruction experiments demonstrated that this correlation behavior was likely not due to crosstalk, as ERK and Akt do not interact in this context, in contrast to other transformed cell types. Overall, our findings support roles for ERK and Akt activity throughout the cell cycle as opposed to just before the restriction point, and suggest ERK activity dynamics may be more important than Akt activity dynamics for driving cell division in this non-transformed context.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36308386": {"ArticleTitle": "Nurses' Perceived Challenges in the Management of Hospitalized Cancer Patients in a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Southeastern Nigeria.", "AbstractText": "Nurses' challenges in poor-resource countries like Nigeria have been understudied.

Thus, antioxidants may inhibit tumorigenesis by preventing OS induced by various oncogenic factors. Antioxidants are hypothesized to inhibit cancer initiation by endorsing DNA repair and suppressing cancer progression by creating an energy crisis for preneoplastic cells, resulting in antiproliferative effects. These effects are referred to as chemopreventive effects mediated by an antioxidant mechanism. In addition, antioxidants minimize chemotherapy-induced nonspecific organ toxicity and prolong survival. Antioxidants also support the prooxidant chemistry that demonstrate chemotherapeutic potential, particularly at high or pharmacological doses and trigger OS by promoting free radical production, which is essential for activating cell death pathways.

In the second research scenario, the easy availability of EVs in body fluids and the specificity of their cargo, which can reflect the cell of origin or disease profiles, turn these into attractive diagnostic tools. EVs with exosome-like characteristics, circulating in the bloodstream and other peripheral biofluids, constitute a non-invasive and rapid alternative to study several conditions, including brain-related disorders. In both cases, several EVs isolation methods are already available, but each neuronal model or biofluid presents its own challenges.

Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have explored the causal effects of IBD on PD and AD. However, only a few studies examined this reverse association. Thus, this study aimed to explore whether there are causal associations of genetically predicted PD and AD with IBD, using a two-sample MR study. Summary statistics for IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, which included the International IBD Genetics Consortium and the UK IBD Genetics Consortium (n=59,957). Genetic variants associated with the largest meta-analysis of GWAS of PD (n=1,474,097) and AD (n=455,258) were used as instrumental variables. We used multiple methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and Robust Adjusted Profile Score (RAPS) methods, to estimate the effects of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD. To confirm the validity of the analysis, we also evaluated the pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis that drive causal associations. The results of the IVW method, WM, and RAPS showed that genetically predicted PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of UC (odds ratio [OR]IVW=1.068, OR WM=1.107, OR RAPS=1.069, all P<0.05). Additionally, we found that there were significant associations of genetically predicted PD with CD (OR IVW=1.064, OR RAPS=1.065, all P<0.05) and IBD (OR IVW=1.062, OR RAPS=1.063, all P<0.05) using the IVW method and RAPS. However, there was no significant causal evidence of genetically predicted AD in IBD, UC, or CD among all MR methods. In all MR analyses, there were no horizontal pleiotropy (all P>0.05), or statistical heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis results of the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that the causal effect estimations of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD were robust. Our MR study corroborated a causal association between genetically predicted PD and IBD but did not support a causal effect of genetically predicted AD on IBD.

In this study, we: 1) quantitatively evaluated the psychosocial health of community-dwelling OAs; 2) quantitatively evaluated the perceived stress of care partners for OAs; 3) qualitatively characterized the experiences and needs of community-dwelling OAs and their care partners; and 4) explored differences in the experiences of care partners of OAs with and without AD/ADRD during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the New York metropolitan area. In this mixed-methods study, telephone interviews were conducted with 26 OAs and 29 care partners (16 of whom cared for OAs with AD/ADRD) from April to July 2020. Quantitative data included: demographics; clinical characteristics (Katz Index of independence in activities of daily living (Katz ADL) and the Lawton-Brody instrumental activities of daily living scale (Lawton-Brody)); and psychosocial health: stress was assessed via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), social isolation via the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS), loneliness via the DeJong Loneliness Scale (DeJong), and depression and anxiety via the Patient Health Questionnaire-Anxiety and Depression (PHQ). Qualitative questions focused on uncovering the experiences and needs of OAs and their care partners.

Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of biomarkers with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia incidence. During 17 years of follow-up, 504 participants were diagnosed with dementia, including 163 Alzheimer's disease and 195 vascular dementia cases. After correction for multiple testing, 58 out of 72 tested (80.6%) biomarkers were statistically significantly associated with all-cause dementia, 22 with Alzheimer's disease, and 33 with vascular dementia incidence. We identified four biomarker clusters, among which the strongest representatives, CX3CL1, EN-RAGE, LAP TGF-beta-1, and VEGF-A, were significantly associated with dementia endpoints independently from other inflammation-related proteins. CX3CL1 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] per 1 standard deviation increase: 1.41 [1.24-1.60]) and EN-RAGE (1.41 [1.25-1.60]) were associated with all-cause dementia incidence, EN-RAGE (1.51 [1.25-1.83]) and LAP TGF-beta-1 (1.46 [1.21-1.76]) with Alzheimer's disease incidence, and VEGF-A (1.43 [1.20-1.70]) with vascular dementia incidence.

Recent studies reported intriguing biphasic trajectories of cortical structural changes in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), comprising decreased mean diffusivity (MD) and increased cortical thickness in cognitively normal amyloid-positive individuals, ahead of increases and decreases, respectively, in subsequent disease stages. To better understand the cytoarchitectural correlates of these observations, we assessed novel cortical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics that are correlated with disruption of cortical minicolumns and protein deposition. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of whole brain and temporal lobe cortical diffusivity measures. Investigation of associations between baseline cortical diffusivity values and 24-month longitudinal structural-MRI changes. Investigations of the relationships between cortical diffusivity measures and biomarkers of neuroinflammation. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Twenty-four amyloid-negative controls (CN-), 28 amyloid-positive controls (CN+), 46 amyloid-positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI+) and 22 amyloid-positive subjects with AD were included. 3DT1 and DTI scans at baseline and approximately 24-month follow-up were used to calculate cortical MD and three novel cortical diffusivity measures: the angle between the radial minicolumnar axis and the principal diffusion direction (AngleR); the diffusion components perpendicular to the minicolumns (PerpPD+), and the principal diffusion component parallel with the minicolumns (ParlPD). Cortical macrostructural measurements (cortical volume fraction and cortical thickness), were used to test the hypothesis that baseline cortical diffusivity values can predict change in structural MRI outcomes over approximately 24 months. CSF soluble TREM2 and progranulin (PGRN) concentrations were used to investigate associations with microglial activity and potentially other aspects of neuroinflammation. Cortical diffusivity metrics revealed a dependence on disease stage, with AngleR and PerpPD+ displaying biphasic relationships and ParlPD a monotonic relationship with clinical severity. The novel metrics were able to differentiate between Amyloid+ and Amyloid- controls (AngleR) and to differentiate among disease stages along the AD continuum (PerpPD+). Linear regression revealed significant associations between baseline cortical diffusivity values and subsequent 24-month longitudinal structural-MRI changes. AngleR values were significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 and PGRN concentrations. Cortical diffusivity parameters reflecting minicolumnar organization and neuroinflammation may provide a sensitive and biologically interpretable measurement of cortex quality and microstructure across the AD continuum.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36148860": {"ArticleTitle": "Accelerated Long-Term Forgetting: Prolonged Delayed Recognition as Sensitive Measurement for Different Profiles of Long-Term Memory and Metacognitive Confidence in Stroke Patients - CORRIGENDUM.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36139084": {"ArticleTitle": "Iron in Alzheimer's Disease: From Physiology to Disease Disabilities.", "AbstractText": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the neurodegeneration processes. Increased oxidative stress damages lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids in brain tissue, and it is tied to the loss of biometal homeostasis. For this reason, attention has been focused on transition metals involved in several biochemical reactions producing ROS. Even though a bulk of evidence has uncovered the role of metals in the generation of the toxic pathways at the base of Alzheimer's disease (AD), this matter has been sidelined by the advent of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis. However, the link between metals and AD has been investigated in the last two decades, focusing on their local accumulation in brain areas known to be critical for AD. Recent evidence revealed a relation between iron and AD, particularly in relation to its capacity to increase the risk of the disease through ferroptosis. In this review, we briefly summarize the major points characterizing the function of iron in our body and highlight why, even though it is essential for our life, we have to monitor its dysfunction, particularly if we want to control our risk of AD.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36081661": {"ArticleTitle": "Oligomeropathies, inflammation and prion protein binding.", "AbstractText": "The central role of oligomers, small soluble aggregates of misfolded proteins, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders is recognized in numerous experimental conditions and is compatible with clinical evidence. To underline this concept, some years ago we coined the term oligomeropathies to define the common mechanism of action of protein misfolding diseases like Alzheimer, Parkinson or prion diseases. Using simple experimental conditions, with direct application of synthetic \u03b2 amyloid or \u03b1-synuclein oligomers intraventricularly at micromolar concentrations, we could detect differences and similarities in the biological consequences. The two oligomer species affected cognitive behavior, neuronal dysfunction and cerebral inflammatory reactions with distinct mechanisms. In these experimental conditions the proposed mediatory role of cellular prion protein in oligomer activities was not confirmed. Together with oligomers, inflammation at different levels can be important early in neurodegenerative disorders; both \u03b2 amyloid and \u03b1-synuclein oligomers induce inflammation and its control strongly affects neuronal dysfunction. This review summarizes our studies with \u03b2-amyloid or \u03b1-synuclein oligomers, also considering the potential curative role of doxycycline, a well-known antibiotic with anti-amyloidogenic and anti-inflammatory activities.

DCs' immunological properties are modulated in response to various stimuli. Active DNA demethylation is crucial for DC differentiation and function. Vitamin C, a known cofactor of ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, drives active demethylation. Vitamin C has recently emerged as a promising adjuvant for several types of cancer; however, its effects on human immune cells are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming orchestrated by vitamin C in monocyte-derived DC differentiation and maturation. Vitamin C triggers extensive demethylation at NF-\u03baB/p65 binding sites, together with concordant upregulation of antigen-presentation and immune response-related genes during DC maturation. p65 interacts with TET2 and mediates the aforementioned vitamin C-mediated changes, as demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition. Moreover, vitamin C increases TNF\u03b2 production in DCs through NF-\u03baB, in concordance with the upregulation of its coding gene and the demethylation of adjacent CpGs.

In the present prospective study, we used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with LC-sensitive sequence (LC-MRI) to investigate in vivo the LC involvement in Alzheimer's disease progression, and whether specific LC-MRI features at baseline are associated with prognosis and cognitive performance in amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment. LC-MRI parameters were measured at baseline by a template-based method on 3.0-T magnetic resonance images in 34 patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia, 73 patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment, and 53 cognitively intact individuals. A thorough neurological and neuropsychological assessment was performed at baseline and 2.5-year follow-up. In subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment who converted to dementia (n\u00a0=\u200932), the LC intensity and number of LC-related voxels were significantly lower than in cognitively intact individuals, resembling those observed in demented patients. Such a reduction was not detected in Mild Cognitive Impairment individuals, who remained stable at follow-up. In Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects converting to dementia, LC-MRI parameter reduction was maximal in the rostral part of the left nucleus.

We here investigated whether moxibustion could alleviate the cognitive impairment of AD by promoting the \"astrocyte-neuron\" interaction and enhancing synaptic plasticity. Moxibustion treatment was administrated to Baihui (GV20) and Yongquan (KI1) in APP/PS1 mice. We first evaluated the behavior of APP/PS1 mice with Morris water maze test, and observed the synaptic structure before and after moxibustion intervention. Then, the transcriptome characteristics (TC) and \"astrocyte-neuron\" interaction were evaluated by spatial transcriptomics (ST). CD38 and its ligand Pecam1, one of the energy shuttle pathways between neurons and astrocytes, were also be detected. The results supported that moxibustion increased learning and memory ability and synaptic structure. ST showed that the TC were more similar between the moxibustion and control groups. Moxibustion enhanced the number of ligand - receptor pairs between astrocytes and neurons. And the score of interaction intensity and the proportion of interaction were also increased. Meanwhile, the energy of astrocytes and neurons was significantly altered. Additionally, moxibustion could significantly improve the function of CD38 and its ligand Pecam1 which were previously reported having the function of transporting mitochondria from astrocytes to neurons, and then providing energy for neurons.

Here, transgenic AD mice were administered with C15AlkOPP through intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion over 13 days. Using prenylomic analysis, 36 prenylated proteins were enriched in the brains of AD mice. Importantly, the prenylated forms of 15 proteins were consistently upregulated in AD mice compared to nontransgenic wild-type controls.

The DLB group showed a significant correlation between masticatory performance and cerebral blood flow in some areas, while no such correlation was observed in the ATD group. Significant correlations were found between periodontal pocket depth and bleeding on probing and cerebral blood flow in some areas in both groups, although the correlation was considerable in the ATD group.

In this study, we explored a novel strategy to improve MBZ efficacy using a drug combination. When glioblastoma cells were treated with MBZ, cell proliferation was dose-dependently inhibited with an IC50 of less than 1 \u03bcM. MBZ treatment also inhibited glioblastoma cell migration with an IC50 of less than 3 \u03bcM in the Boyden chamber migration assay.

Then, at 72 h of treatment, it mainly caused cell death in U87 cells with an increased sub-G1 fraction, whereas polyploidy was seen in U373 cells. However, MBZ treatment did not affect ERK1/2 activation stimulated by growth factors. The marked induction of autophagy by MBZ was observed, without any increased expression of autophagy-related genes ATG5/7 and Beclin 1. Co-treatment with MBZ and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) markedly enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of MBZ in the cells. Triple combination treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) (another autophagy inducer) further enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of MBZ and CQ.

Claudin-1 (CLDN1) is a membrane protein expressed not only at tight junctions but also non-junctionally such as the basolateral membrane of the human hepatocyte. While CLDN1 within tight junctions is well characterized, the role of non-junctional CLDN1 and its role as a therapeutic target in HCC remains unexplored. Using humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting specifically the extracellular loop of human non-junctional CLDN1 and a large series of patient-derived cell-based and animal model systems we aimed to investigate the role of CLDN1 as a therapeutic target for HCC. Targeting non-junctional CLDN1 markedly suppressed tumor growth and invasion in cell line-based models of HCC and patient-derived 3D ex vivo models. Moreover, the robust effect on tumor growth was confirmed in vivo in a large series of cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Mechanistic studies including single-cell RNA sequencing of multicellular patient HCC tumorspheres suggested that CLDN1 regulates tumor stemness, metabolism, oncogenic signaling and perturbs the tumor immune microenvironment. Our results provide the rationale for targeting CLDN1 in HCC and pave the way to novel therapeutic interventions with CLDN1 mAbs aimed at improving the limited efficacy of current therapies. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a cancer with high mortality and unsatisfactory treatment options. Here we identified the cell surface protein Claudin-1 as a target for treatment of advanced HCC. Monoclonal antibodies targeting Claudin-1 inhibit tumor growth in patient-derived ex vivo and in vivo models by modulating signaling, cell stemness and the tumor immune microenvironment.

To meet this challenge, this study describes the design of a theranostic nanogel, enriched in 10B and fluorescent dye, to achieve selective imaging, and sufficient accumulation of boron at the tumor site. The boron-rich and fluorescent nanogels can be easily obtained via temperature triggered-assembly of hyaluronic acid (HA) modified with a thermoresponsive terpolymer.

However, the linearity of the fixed-effect structure in these models largely restrict their use to estimating treatment effects that are defined as linear combinations of effects on the outcome scale. In some situations, alternative quantifications of treatment effects may be more appropriate. In progressive diseases, for example, one may want to estimate if a drug has cumulative effects resulting in increasing efficacy over time or whether it slows the time progression of disease. This article introduces a class of nonlinear mixed-effects models called progression models for repeated measures (PMRMs) that, based on a continuous-time extension of the categorical-time parametrization of MMRMs, enables estimation of novel types of treatment effects, including measures of slowing or delay of the time progression of disease. Compared to conventional estimates of treatment effects where the unit matches that of the outcome scale (eg, 2 points benefit on a cognitive scale), the time-based treatment effects can offer better interpretability and clinical meaningfulness (eg, 6\u00a0months delay in progression of cognitive decline). The PMRM class includes conventionally used MMRMs and related models for longitudinal data analysis, as well as variants of previously proposed disease progression models as special cases. The potential of the PMRM framework is illustrated using both simulated and historical data from clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease with different types of artificially simulated treatment effects. Compared to conventional models it is shown that PMRMs can offer substantially increased power to detect disease-modifying treatment effects where the benefit is increasing with treatment duration.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36307456": {"ArticleTitle": "Differential analysis of microbiomes in mucus and tissues obtained from colorectal cancer patients.", "AbstractText": "The outer mucus layer of the colorectal epithelium is easily removable and colonized by commensal microbiota, while the inner mucus layer is firmly attached to the epithelium and devoid of bacteria.

The effects of BBR on the activations of EGF/EGFR and its downstream effectors were demonstrated using Western blotting. BBR inhibited growth of CCA cells in a dose dependent manner. At sub-cytotoxic dose, BBR significantly inhibited cell adhesion, migration, invasion and decreased expression of vimentin, slug, and VEGFA of both CCA cell lines. Molecular docking suggested the simultaneous inhibitory activity of BBR on EGFR, Erk, STAT3 and Akt. The Western blot analyses revealed that upon the EGF/EGFR activation, BBR considerably attenuated the activations of EGFR, Erk, STAT3 and Akt.

This study included patients treated with primary, single-session SRS for Koos grade IV VS at 10 participating centers. Only those patients presenting with non-life-threatening or incapacitating symptoms and at least 12 months of clinical and neuroimaging follow-up were eligible for inclusion. Relevant data were collected, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to perform time-dependent analysis for post-SRS tumor control, hearing preservation, and facial nerve function preservation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for outcome measures using Cox regression analysis. Six hundred twenty-seven patients (344 females, median patient age 54 [IQR 22] years) treated with primary SRS were included in this study. The median tumor volume was 8.7 (IQR 5) cm3.

This review is primarily concerned with HD, which was fully described by George Huntington in 1872. In developed countries, HD has become another common single-gene neurological disorder. Because of its autosomal dominant inheritance, the sickness affects both individuals and their families. Huntington disease has been recognized as a disorder that affects the complete body and brain in which the mutant huntingtin polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence is extensively increased and gets correlated to CAG trinucleotide which codes for glutamine (Q). These proteins have characteristics that produce apoptosis and dysfunction. HD is a lethal condition which needs an immediate diagnosis and treatment, and therefore, nanoparticle has come into sight out as opportunistic strategies for treatment of HD. Nanostructures have great potential to cross the blood brain barrier and also prevent breakdown of active molecule and reduces the drug toxicity. This review explains the distinguishing symptoms, genetics, and stages during the development of Huntington's disease, and also provides an overview of HD with an emphasis on its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management.

Up to 40% of patients may develop locoregional disease as the first site of failure. As such, there may be a role for intensification of local therapy such as radiation therapy. Radiation dose escalation for pancreatic cancer is limited by proximity of the tumor to the duodenum. However, the duodenum is removed during Whipple procedure, allowing the opportunity to dose escalate with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Although prior studies have shown potential benefit of IORT in pancreatic cancer, these studies did not utilize ablative doses (biologically effective dose [BED10]\u2009>\u2009100\u00a0Gy). Furthermore, the optimal radiation target volume in this setting is unclear. There has been increased interest in a \"Triangle Volume\" (TV), bordered by the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, common hepatic artery, portal vein, and superior mesenteric vein. Dissection of this area, has been advocated for by surgeons from Heidelberg as it contains extra-pancreatic perineural and lymphatic tracts, which may harbor microscopic disease at risk of mediating local failure. Interestingly, a recent analysis from our institution indicated that nearly all local failures occur in the TV. Therefore, the purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the safety of delivering an ablative radiation dose to the TV with IORT following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Patients with non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma centered in the head or neck of the pancreas will be enrolled. Following treatment with multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients will undergo SBRT (40\u00a0Gy/5 fractions) followed by IORT (15\u00a0Gy/1 fraction) to the TV during the Whipple procedure. The primary objective is acute (<\u200990\u00a0days) toxicity after IORT measured by Clavien-Dindo classification.

To better understand the use of automatic transcription for classification of neurodegenerative disease, namely, Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or subjective memory complaints (SMC) versus healthy controls, we compared automatically generated transcripts against transcripts that went through manual correction. We recruited individuals from a memory clinic (\"patients\") with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD, (n=44, 30%), MCI (n=20, 13%), SMC (n=8, 5%), as well as healthy controls (n=77, 52%) living in the community.

We compared transcripts generated using Google speech-to-text software to manually verified transcripts by examining transcription confidence scores, transcription error rates, and machine learning classification accuracy. For the classification tasks, logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, and random forests were used.

This comparison showed no difference in the reading task. Manually adding pauses to transcripts had no impact on classification performance. However, manually correcting both spontaneous speech tasks led to significantly higher performances in the machine learning models. We found that automatically transcribed speech data could be used to distinguish patients with a diagnosis of AD, MCI, or SMC from controls. We recommend a human verification step to improve the performance of automatic transcripts, especially for spontaneous tasks. Moreover, human verification can focus on correcting errors and adding punctuation to transcripts.

Its deregulation is associated with many pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disease, frequently downregulated.

Interestingly, novel Wnt signaling activating compounds are less frequently described than inhibitors, turning the quest for novel positive modulators even more appealing. In that sense, natural compounds are an outstanding source of potential drug leads. Here, we combine different experimental models, cell-based approaches, neuronal culture assays, and rodent behavior tests with Xenopus laevis phenotypic analysis to characterize quercitrin, a natural compound, as a novel Wnt signaling potentiator. We find that quercitrin potentiates the signaling in a concentration-dependent manner and increases the occurrence of the Xenopus secondary axis phenotype mediated by Xwnt8 injection.

Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor downstream of GSK3, impairs the quercitrin-mediated effect. Next, we show that quercitrin potentiates the Wnt3a-synaptogenic effect in hippocampal neurons in culture, which is blocked by XAV939. Quercitrin treatment also rescues the hippocampal synapse loss induced by intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2O) in mice.

Among three fractions of AT root extract, hexane fraction (HAT) significantly decreased the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Besides, HAT treatment dose-dependently inhibited colony formation of NSCLC cells. These effects were associated with apoptosis induction evidenced by increased chromatin condensation, accumulation of sub-G1 DNA content and annexin V-positive cells, and enhanced expression of apoptotic proteins, including cleaved-caspases and cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Notably, phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Src were decreased by HAT. Transfection with STAT3 or Src for constitutive activation reversed the anti-proliferative effect of HAT on H1299 cells.

However, quantification of cell interphase times and the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs targeting specific cell cycle phases cannot be determined directly. We present a data driven computational cell population model for interpreting experimental results, where in-silico populations are initialized to match observable results from experimental populations. A two-stage approach is used to determine the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs in blocking cell-cycle phase transitions. In the first stage, our model is fitted to experimental multi-parameter flow cytometry results from untreated cell populations to identify parameters defining probability density functions for phase transitions. In the second stage, we introduce a blocking routine to the model which blocks a percentage of attempted transitions between cell-cycle phases due to therapeutic treatment. The resulting model closely matches the percentage of cells from experiment in each cell-cycle phase and division round.

Organisms have many ways of repairing DSBs, including use of homologous sequences through homology-directed repair (HDR). While HDR repair is often error-free, in single-strand annealing (SSA) homologous repeats flanking a DSB are annealed to one another, leading to deletion of one repeat and the intervening sequences. Studies in yeast have shown a relationship between the length of the repeat and SSA efficacy. We sought to determine the effects of homology length on SSA in Drosophila, as Drosophila uses a different annealing enzyme (Marcal1) than yeast. Using an in vivo SSA assay, we show that 50 base pairs (bp) is insufficient to promote SSA and that 500-2000\u2009bp is required for maximum efficiency. Loss of Marcal1 generally followed the same homology length trend as wild-type flies, with SSA frequencies reduced to about a third of wild-type frequencies regardless of homology length. Interestingly, we find a difference in SSA rates between 500\u2009bp homologies that align to the annealing target either nearer or further from the DSB, a phenomenon that may be explained by Marcal1 dynamics.

Its antidepressant constituent, hyperforin, has properties such as chemical instability and induction of drug-drug interactions that preclude its use for individual pharmacotherapies. Here we identify the transient receptor potential canonical 6 channel (TRPC6) as a druggable target to control anxious and depressive behavior and as a requirement for hyperforin antidepressant action. We demonstrate that TRPC6 deficiency in mice not only results in anxious and depressive behavior, but also reduces excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells. Using electrophysiology and targeted mutagenesis, we show that hyperforin activates the channel via a specific binding motif at TRPC6. We performed an analysis of hyperforin action to develop a new antidepressant drug that uses the same TRPC6 target mechanism for its antidepressant action. We synthesized the hyperforin analog Hyp13, which shows similar binding to TRPC6 and recapitulates TRPC6-dependent anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in mice. Hyp13 does not activate pregnan-X-receptor (PXR) and thereby loses the potential to induce drug-drug interactions.

Stereology analysis of this calibration process produced a good correlation between the experts for both epithelium and immunostaining detection. There was also a good correlation between the experts and image processing. Image processing clearly revealed the respective proportions of low, medium, and high areas in a single tumor and showed that this parameter of heterogeneity could be included in a composite score, thus decreasing the level of discrepancy. Therefore, agreement with the pathologist was increased by taking heterogeneity into account. This simple, robust, calibrated method using basic tools and known parameters can be used to quantify and characterize the expression of protein biomarkers within the different tumor compartments. It is based on known mathematical thresholds and takes the intratumoral heterogeneity of staining into account. Although some discrepancies need to be diminished, correlation with the pathologist's classification was satisfactory. The method is replicable and can be used to analyze other biological and medical issues. This non-subjective technique for assessing protein biomarker expression uses a fully automated choice of thresholds (GMM) and defined composite scores that take the intra-tumor heterogeneity of immunostaining into account.

Their implication in pathologies is well documented for epilepsy. The higher prevalence of epileptic symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients questions the role of KARs in AD. Here we investigated whether the synaptic expression and function of KARs was impaired in mouse models of AD. We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude and decay time of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (male and female APP/PS1 mice) of AD. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was observed in CA3 pyramidal cells in male and female mice with a genetic deletion of either presenilin or APP/APLP2 as well as in organotypic cultures treated with \u03b3-secretase inhibitors. Finally, the GluK2 protein interacts with full-length and C-terminal fragments of APP. Overall, our data suggest that APP stabilizes KARs at synapses, possibly through a trans-synaptic mechanism, and this interaction is under the control the \u03b3-secretase proteolytic activity of presenilin.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:Synaptic impairment correlates strongly with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, many studies have addressed the dysregulation of AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). Kainate receptors (KARs) which form the third family of iGluRs, represent an underestimated actor in the regulation of neuronal circuits and have not yet been examined in the context of AD. Here we provide evidence that synaptic KARs are markedly impaired in a mouse model of AD. Further experiments indicate that the gamma-secretase activity of presenilin acting on the Amyloid Precursor Protein controls synaptic expression of KAR. This study clearly indicates that KARs should be taken into consideration whenever addressing synaptic dysfunction and related cognitive deficits in the context of AD.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36273347": {"ArticleTitle": "The clinical heterogeneity of subjective cognitive decline: a data-driven approach on a population-based sample.", "AbstractText": "subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to the subjective experience of cognitive decline in the absence of detectable cognitive impairment.

However, the relationships between protein synthesis deregulation and ER stress/UPR, as well as their role in the altered homeostatic support of Alzheimer's disease (AD) astrocytes remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2\u03b1 and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker (EML) resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2\u03b1 without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2\u03b1 and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent. Next, we investigated the ability of 3xTg-AD astrocytes to support metabolism and function of other cells of the central nervous system. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from 3Tg-iAstro cells significantly reduced protein synthesis rate in primary hippocampal neurons.

Inhibiting epichaperomes induces degradation of disease associated proteins and is a promising therapeutic approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's Disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This Phase 1 clinical study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of icapamespib, a purine scaffold inhibitor of epichaperomes that is specific to epichaperomes, in healthy subjects.

Safety was evaluated based on assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. Icapamespib concentration was evaluated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, the latter in Part 2 (multiple ascending dose) only.

Some of the marine compounds reported here have shown an excellent potential for butyrylcholinesterase inhibition compared to standard inhibitors. Further studies of some compounds reported here may lead to the development of a new treatment for AD.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36307150": {"ArticleTitle": "Autophagic flux restoration enhances the antitumor efficacy of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.", "AbstractText": "Although adoptive cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has mediated effective antitumor responses in several cancers, dysfunction and exhaustion of TILs significantly impair the therapeutic effect of TILs. Thus, it is essential to elucidate the exhausted characteristics of TILs and improve the antitumor effect of TILs by reversing their exhaustion. Here, we focused on the influence of autophagy on TILs in terms of T-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. We first evaluated autophagy level of TILs and influence of spermidine treatment on autophagy levels of TILs. Furthermore, we assessed the proliferative potential, phenotypical characteristics, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and antitumor activity of TILs with and without spermidine treatment. We found that autophagic flux of TILs, especially exhausted TILs that express inhibitory immunoreceptors and have impaired proliferative capacity and decreased production of cytotoxic effector molecules, was significantly impaired. The restoration of autophagic flux via spermidine treatment resulted in increased diversity of the TCR repertoire, reduced expression of inhibitory immunoreceptors (PD1, TIM3, or LAG3), enhanced proliferation and effector functions, which subsequently demonstrated the superior in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of TILs. Our findings unveil that spermidine, as an autophagy inducer, reverses dysfunction and exhaustion of TILs and subsequently improves the antitumor activity of TILs. These data suggest that spermidine treatment presents an opportunity to improve adoptive TIL therapy for the treatment of solid tumors.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36219131": {"ArticleTitle": "Computer-based Eye-tracking Analysis of King-Devick Test Differentiates Persons With Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus From Cognitively Unimpaired.", "AbstractText": "Functional defects in eye movements and reduced reading speed in neurodegenerative diseases represent a potential new biomarker to support clinical diagnosis.

Herein, we firstly develop an intriguing approach that enables spatiotemporally controlled formation and rotation of magnetic nanochains in vivo, allowing for precise mechanotherapy of tumor with minimal side effects. The building blocks of the nanochain are hybrid nanocomposites of pheophorbide-A (PP) modified iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and lanthanide-doped down-conversion nanoparticles (DCNPs). By applying permanent magnetic field, the nanocomposites would be aligned to form nanochain. Next, MnO 2 NPs were subsequently administrated to accumulate in tumors as supplier of Mn 2+ , which effectively coordinates with the PP located at the joint the nanocomposite to immobilize the formed nanochains. In rotating magnetic field, the nanochains would rapidly rotate, leading to mechanical damage to organelles and cytoskeletons, and consequently resulting in apoptosis/necrosis of tumor cells. Furthermore, the IONPs and DCNPs showed high T 2 -MR and NIR-II fluorescence imaging performances, respectively, which systematically facilitate to determine the tumor location and guide therapy.

They exhibit diverse pharmacological potentials including radical scavenging, as well as neuroprotective, anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activities, owing to their diverse chemical scaffolds. Saponins consist of an aglycone part (non-sugar) and a glycone part (sugar) and have at least one glycosidic (C-O sugar bond) linkage present between the glycone and aglycone mostly at C-3. On the basis of the aglycone part, saponins are classified into triterpenoid glycosides, steroid glycosides and alkaloid glycosides. Saponins exhibit neuroprotective activities against various disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) including stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). They mediate their therapeutic effects by modulation of various pathological targets. This study highlights various neuroprotective mechanisms of saponins including free radical scavenging, modulation of neuroprotective signaling pathways, activation of neurotrophic factors, modulation of neurotransmitters, inhibition of BACE1 enzyme and tau hyper-phosphorylation. The study concludes that saponins have considerable efficacy against various pathological targets of neurological disorders, especially AD, and might be an important source of leads against neurodegenerative disorders.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36185489": {"ArticleTitle": "Blood pressure trajectories over 35 years and dementia risk: A retrospective study: The HUNT study.", "AbstractText": "High blood pressure is a well-established risk factor of dementia.

Specifically, we hypothesized that older cognitive healthy participants would exhibit comparable performance when the task was explicit and relied on conscious cognition. However, when the task was implicit, the performance of participants at high and low risks for AD would bifurcate. That is, early changes in unconscious cognition could be linked to cognitive health. We measured implicit interference elicited by an imperceptible distractor in cognitively healthy elderly participants with normal (low risk) and pathological (high risk) A\u03b242/total tau ratio. Participants were required to perform a Stroop task (word-naming or color-naming on an ink-semantics inconsistent word) with a visually masked distractor presented prior to the target task. We found that, under a high-effort task (i.e., color-naming in the Stroop task), high-risk participants suffered interference when the imperceptible distractor and the subsequent target were incongruent in the responses they triggered. Their reaction times were slowed down by approximately 4%. This implicit interference was not found in the low-risk participants. These findings indicate that weakened inhibition of distracting implicit information can be a potential behavioral biomarker of early identification of AD pathology.

The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the main route of TRP catabolism into nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+), and metabolites of this pathway may have protective or degenerative effects on the nervous system. Thus, the KP may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the changes in KP metabolites such as TRP, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), Anthranilic acid (AA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) patients compared to the control group. We conducted a literature search using PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and EMBASE electronic databases to find articles published up to 2022. Studies measuring TRP, KYN, KYNA, AA, 3-HK, 5-HIAA, 3-HANA in AD, PD, or HD patients and controls were identified. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used to determine the differences in the levels of the KP metabolites between the two groups.

The gas chromatography (GC) was used to determine the ability of PA to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rats after oral administration.

MWM test results showed that PA could significantly ameliorate the learning and memory deficits induced by STZ in rats. Meanwhile, PA enhanced the expression of SIRT1, and markedly alleviated the tau pathology by inhibiting the hyperacetylation (at the site of Lys174) and hyperphosphorylation (at the sites of Thr181, Thr205, Ser396 and Ser404) of tau protein. PA also efficiently suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) expression and the deacetylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) at Lys 310 (K310) in the STZ-treated AD rats.

This study reported for the first time that PA could penetrate the BBB to exert its protective effects on the brain after a single-dose oral administration. The current experimental findings also amply demonstrated that PA could improve the cognitive and memory impairments in the STZ-induced AD rat model.

In 2019, the global ASMR and ASDR for lung cancer attributable to residential radon exposure were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.20, 2.00) and 22.66 (95% CI: 4.49, 43.94) per 100\u2009000 population, which were 15.6% and 23.0% lower than in 1990, respectively. According to the estimation, we found the lung cancer burden attributable to residential radon exposure declined significantly in high and high-middle SDI regions, but substantially increased in middle and low-middle SDI regions from 1990 to 2019. Across age and sex, the highest burden of lung cancer attributable to residential radon exposure was found in males and elderly groups. In conclusion, the global burden of lung cancer attributable to residential radon exposure showed a declining trend from 1990 to 2019, but a relatively large increase was found in the middle SDI regions. In 2019, the burden of lung cancer attributable to residential radon exposure remained high, particularly in males, the elderly, and high-middle SDI regions compared with other groups.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36306497": {"ArticleTitle": "Oligometastases: Emerging Evidence.", "AbstractText": "The hypothesis that ablative therapies (such as surgery or radiation) can be used to cure patients with a limited number of metastases was influential in changing practice.

We present an unsupervised learning method for fMRI data, called Clusterwise Independent Component Analysis (C-ICA). This enables the clustering of patients into neurofunctional subtypes based on differences in shared ICA-derived RSNs. The parameters are estimated simultaneously, which leads to an improved estimation of subtypes and their associated RSNs. In five simulation studies, the C-ICA model is successfully validated using both artificially and realistically simulated data (N\u00a0=\u00a030-40). The successful performance of the C-ICA model is also illustrated on an empirical data set consisting of Alzheimer's disease patients and elderly control subjects (N\u00a0=\u00a0250). C-ICA is able to uncover a meaningful clustering that partially matches (balanced accuracy = .72) the diagnostic labels and identifies differences in RSNs between the Alzheimer and control cluster. Both in the simulation study and the empirical application, C-ICA yields better results compared to competing clustering methods (i.e., a two step clustering procedure based on single subject ICA's and a Group ICA plus dual regression variant thereof) that do not simultaneously estimate a clustering and associated RSNs. Indeed, the overall mean adjusted Rand Index, a measure for cluster recovery, equals 0.65 for C-ICA and ranges from 0.27 to 0.46 for competing methods. The successful performance of C-ICA indicates that it is a promising method to extract neurofunctional subtypes from multi-subject resting state-fMRI data.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women after lung cancer. Therefore, finding new therapeutic methods could potentially help to reduce breast cancer mortality and increase the survival rate. Wharton jelly stem cells with mesenchymal morphology play an important role in inhibiting the progression of ovarian, osteosarcoma, and breast cancer by inducing apoptosis and reducing metastasis. Several environmental and genetic factors are involved in the occurrence of breast cancer. CXCR4 and VLA-4 genes are important genetic factors in breast cancer that play a role in cell survival, migration, proliferation, and metastasis of several types of cancer, especially breast cancer. Therefore, inhibition of these two genes by Wharton's Jelly Stem Cells could be a novel and effective therapeutic target in breast cancer. \u00a0The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Wharton jelly stem cells secretion on the expression of CXCR4 and VLA-4 genes in cancer cells.

Compared to WT, TgF344-AD rats replicated common findings in AD patients, including decreased N-acetylaspartate in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased glutamate in the thalamus and striatum. Different longitudinal evolution of metabolic concentration was observed between TgF344-AD and WT groups. Namely, age-dependent trajectories differed between groups for creatine in the cortex and thalamus and for taurine in cortex, with significant decreases in Tg344-AD animals; whereas myo-inositol in the thalamus and striatum showed greater increase along time in the WT group. Additional analysis revealed divergent intra- and inter-regional metabolic coupling in each group.

These regions are known to distinguish DLB and AD pathology cross-sectionally, but here are shown to distinguish longitudinal disease progression.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36152679": {"ArticleTitle": "Cdk5-p25 as a key element linking amyloid and tau pathologies in Alzheimer's disease: Mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.", "AbstractText": "Despite the fact that the small atypical serine/threonine cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is expressed in a number of tissues, its activity is restricted to the central nervous system due to the neuron-only localization of its activators p35 and p39. Although its importance for the proper development and function of the brain and its role as a switch between neuronal survival and death are unmistakable and unquestionable, Cdk5 is nevertheless increasingly emerging, as supported by a large number of publications on the subject, as a therapeutic target of choice in the fight against Alzheimer's disease. Thus, its aberrant over activation via the calpain-dependent conversion of p35 into p25 is observed during the pathogenesis of the disease where it leads to the hyperphosphorylation of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein and tau. The present review highlights the pivotal roles of the hyperactive Cdk5-p25 complex activity in contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, with a particular emphasis on the linking function between A\u03b2 and tau that this kinase fulfils and on the fact that Cdk5-p25 is part of a deleterious feed forward loop giving rise to a molecular machinery runaway leading to AD pathogenesis. Additionally, we discuss the advances and challenges related to the possible strategies aimed at specifically inhibiting Cdk5-p25 activity and which could lead to promising anti-AD therapeutics.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36306582": {"ArticleTitle": "Characterization of drug effects on cell cultures from phase-contrast microscopy images.", "AbstractText": "In this work, we classify chemotherapeutic agents (topoisomerase inhibitors) based on their effect on U-2 OS cells. We use phase-contrast microscopy images, which are faster and easier to obtain than fluorescence images and support live cell imaging. We use a\u00a0convolutional neural network (CNN) trained end-to-end directly on the input images without requiring for manual segmentations or any other auxiliary data. Our method can distinguish between tested cytotoxic drugs with an accuracy of 98%, provided that their mechanism of action differs, outperforming previous work. The results are even better when substance-specific concentrations are used. We show the benefit of sharing the extracted features over all classes (drugs). Finally, a\u00a02D visualization of these features reveals clusters, which correspond well to known class labels, suggesting the possible use of our methodology for drug discovery application in analyzing new, unseen drugs.", "query": "Cancer"}}
